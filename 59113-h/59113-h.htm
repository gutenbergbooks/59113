    <div>NORTH OF “SIXTY”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The sub-Arctic summer was at its height. The
swelter of heat was of almost tropical intensity. No wisp of
cloud marred the perfect purity of the steely blue sky, and no
breath of wind relieved the intemperate scorch of the blazing
sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two men on the river bank gave no heed to the oppressive
heat. For the moment they seemed concerned with nothing but their
ease, and the swarming flies, and the voracious attacks of the
mosquitoes from which the smoke of their camp fire did its best
to protect them. Down below them, a few yards away, their
walrus-hide kyak lay moored to the bank of the river, whose
sluggish, oily-moving waters flowed gently northward towards the
far-off fields of eternal ice. It was noon, and a rough midday
meal had been prepared and disposed of. Now they were smoking
away a leisurely hour before resuming their journey.</p>

<p class='c010'>The younger of the two flung away the end of a cigarette with
a movement that was almost violent in its impatience. He turned a
pair of narrow black eyes upon his companion, and their sparkle
of resentment shone fiercely in sharp contrast against the dusky
skin of their setting.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s no use blinding ourselves, sir,” he said, speaking
rapidly in the tongue of the whiteman, with only the faintest
suspicion of native halting. “It’s here. But we’ve missed it. And
another’s found it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was a youthful creature something short of the completion
of his second decade. But that which he lacked in years he made
up for in the alertness of purpose that looked out of his keen
eyes. He was dark-skinned, its hue something between yellow and
olive. He had prominent, broad cheek bones like those of all the
natives of Canada’s extreme north. Yet his face differed from the
general low type of the Eskimo. There was refinement in every
detail of it. There was something that suggested a race quite
foreign, but curiously akin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Marty Le Gros? Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The older man stirred. He had been lounging full length on the
ground so that the smoke of the camp fire rolled heavily across
him, and kept him safe from the torment of winged insects. Now he
sat up like the other, and crossing his legs tucked his booted
feet under him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was older than his companion by more than twenty years. But
the likeness between them was profound. He, too, was dusky. He,
too, had the broad, high cheek bones. He was of similar stature,
short and broad. Then, too, his hair was black and cut short like
the other’s, so short, indeed, that it bristled crisply over the
crown of his bare head with the effect of a wire brush. He, too,
was clad in the rough buckskin of the trail with no detail that
could have distinguished him from the native. The only difference
between the two was in age, and the colour of their eyes. The
older man’s eyes were a sheer anachronism. They were a curious
gleaming yellow, whose tawny depths shone with a subtle
reflection of the brilliant sunshine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me of it again, Sate,” he went on, knocking out the red
clay pipe he had been smoking, and re-filling it from a beaded
buckskin pouch.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the youth was impatient, and the quick flash of his black
eyes was full of scorn for the unruffled composure of the
other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s beaten us, father,” he cried. “He has it. I have seen.”
He spread out his hands in an expressive gesture. And they were
lean, delicate hands that were almost womanish. “This priest-man
with his say-so of religion. He search all the time. It is the
only thing he think of. Gold! Well, he get it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He finished up with a laugh that only expressed fierce
chagrin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he get it here on this Loon Creek, that you make us waste
three months’ search on, son?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The father shook his head. And his eyes were cold, and the
whole expression of his set features mask-like. The youth flung
out his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I go down for trade to Fort Cupar. This missionary, Marty Le
Gros, is there. He show this thing. Two great nuggets, clear
yellow gold. Big? They must be one hundred ounces each. No. Much
more. And he tell the story to McLeod, who drinks so much, that
he find them on Loon Creek. I hear him tell. I listen all the
time. They don’t know me. They think I am a fool Eskimo. I let
them think. Well? Where is it on Loon Creek? We go up. We come
down. There is no sign anywhere. No work. The man lies, for all
his religion. Or we are the fools we do not think we are.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sate turned his searching eyes on the northern distance, where
the broad stream merged itself into the purple of low, far-off
hills.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a scene common enough to the lower lands of Canada’s
extreme north. There was nothing of barren desolation. There were
no great hills, no great primordial forests along the broad
valley of Loon Creek. But it was a widespread park land of
woodland bluffs of hardy conifers dotting a brilliant-hued carpet
of myriads of Arctic flowers, and long sun-forced grasses, and
lichens of every shade of green. It was Nature’s own secret
flower garden, far out of the common human track, where,
throughout the ages, she had spent her efforts in enriching the
soil, till, under an almost tropical summer heat, it yielded a
display of vivid colour such as could never have been matched in
any wilderness under southern skies.</p>

<p class='c010'>The older man observed him keenly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sate, my son,” he said at last, “you are discontented. Why?
This man has a secret. He has gold. Gold is the thing we look
for. Not all the time, but between our trade which makes us rich,
and our people rich. We are masters of the north country. It is
ours by right of the thing we do. It must be ours. And all its
secrets. This man’s secret. We must have it, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man spoke quietly. He spoke without a smile, without
emotion. His tawny eyes were expressionless, for all the blaze of
light the sun reflected in them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are right to be discontented,” he went on, after the
briefest pause. “But I look no longer on Loon Creek or any other
creek. We get this secret from Marty Le Gros. I promise
that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The youth’s quick eyes were searching his father’s face. He
had listened to the thing he had hoped to hear. And now he was
stirred to a keen expectancy that was without impatience.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other shrugged his powerful shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will tell it to us—himself.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The black eyes of the youth abruptly shifted their gaze.
Something in the curious eyes of his parent communicated the
purpose lying behind his words. But it was insufficient to
satisfy his headlong impulse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He? He tell his secret to—us?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was derision in the challenge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. He will tell—when I ask him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it is far south and west. It is beyond—our territory. It
is within the reach of the northern police. There is big risk for
you to ask him the—question.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the man with the yellow eyes shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your mother looked for you to be a girl. Maybe her wish had
certain effect. Risk? There is no risk. I see none. It is simple.
I bend this man to my will. If he will not bend I break him. Yes.
He is white. That is as it should be. Someday—sometime the whites
of this country will bend, or break before us. They know that.
They fear that. The thing they do not yet know is that they bend
now. This man, Le Gros, we will see to him without delay.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose from his cross-legged position almost without an
effort. He stood up erect, a short, broad-shouldered, virile
specimen of manhood in his hard trail clothing. Then he moved
swiftly down towards the light canoe at the water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The youth, Sate, was slow to follow him. He watched the sturdy
figure with unsmiling eyes. He resented the imputation upon his
courage. He resented the taunt his father had flung. But his
feelings carried nothing deeper than the natural resentment of a
war-like, high-strung spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>He understood his father. He knew him for a creature of iron
nerve, and a will that drove him without mercy. More than that he
admitted the man’s right to say the thing he chose to his son.
His attitude was one of curious filial submission whatever the
hurt he suffered. He may have been inspired by affection, or it
may simply have been an expression of the filial obedience and
subservience native to the race from which he sprang. But the
taunt hurt him sorely. And he jumped to a decision as violent as
it was impulsive.</p>

<p class='c010'>He leapt to his feet, slight, active as a panther, and hastily
descended to the water’s edge and joined his parent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You think me like a woman, father? You think that?” he
demanded hotly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other turned eyes that gained nothing of gentleness from
their smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said, and bent again to his work of hauling the
little craft clear of the drift-wood that had accumulated about
it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The youth breathed a deep sigh. It was an expression of
relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We put that question to this Le Gros soon? Yes?” he
asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sate nodded, and a great light shone in his black eyes. They
were fierce with exultation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then we must waste no time. The way is long. There are many
miles to Fox Bluff.” He laughed. “Le Gros,” he went on. “It is a
French name, and it means—Tcha!” he exclaimed with all the
impetuous feeling which drove him like a whirlwind. “We show him
what it means.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man with the tawny eyes looked up from his work. For one
moment he gazed searchingly into the dark face of his son. Then
he returned again to his work without a word.</p>

    <div>THE HOLOCAUST</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Man, I’d sooner they’d put out my eyes, or cut
out my tongue. I’d sooner they’d set my body to everlasting
torture. Look! Look there! Yes, and there! Oh, God! It’s
everywhere the same.” A shaking hand was outthrust. “Dead!
Mutilated! Old men! Old women! And poor little bits of life that
had only just begun. The barbarity! The monstrousness!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros, the missionary of the Hekor River, spoke in a
tone that was almost choking with grief. His eyes, so dark and
wide, were full of the horror upon which they gazed. His Gallic
temperament was stirred to its depths. The heart of the man was
overflowing with pity and grief, and outraged parental
affection.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak, the Indian, his servant, stood beside him. He offered no
verbal comment. His only reply to the white-man was a low,
fierce, inarticulate grunt, which was like the growl of some
savage beast.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men were standing at the entrance to a wide clearing. The
great Hekor River flowed behind them, where the canoe they had
just left swung to the stream, moored at the crude landing stage
of native manufacture. They were gazing upon the setting of a
little Eskimo encampment. It was one of the far flung Missions
which claimed the spiritual service of Le Gros. He had only just
arrived from his headquarters at Fox Bluff, on the river, near by
to Fort Cupar the trading post, on his monthly visit, and the
hideous destruction he had discovered left him completely
staggered and helpless.</p>

<p class='c010'>The devastation of the settlement was complete. Dotted about
the clearing, grimly silhouetted against a background of dull
green woods, stood the charred remains of a dozen and more log
shanties. Broken and burnt timbers littered the open ground, and
filled the room spaces where the roofs had fallen. Every
habitation was burnt out stark. Not even the crude household
goods had been spared.</p>

<p class='c010'>But this was the least of the horror the two men gazed upon.
The human aspect of the destruction was a thousand-fold more
appalling. The ground was littered with mutilated dead. As the
missionary had said, there were old men, old women, and babes
torn from their mothers’ arms. Silent and still, death reigned
everywhere. The young men? The young women? There was no sign of
these. And therein lay a further horror which the onlookers were
swift to appreciate.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hideous fascination of the scene held them. But at last it
was Usak who broke from under its spell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Euralians!” he cried fiercely. And again in his voice rang
that note which sounded like the goaded fury of some creature of
the forest.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Euralians!</p>

<p class='c010'>To the mind of every far northwestern man, in that territory
which lies hundreds of miles beyond the efficient protection of
the northern police, the name of this people was sufficient to
set stirring a chill of unvoiced terror that was something
superstitious. Who they were? It was almost impossible to say. It
was still a problem in the minds of even the farthest travelled
trail men and fur hunters. But they were known to all as a
scourge of the far flung border which divides Alaska from the
extreme north of Yukon Territory.</p>

<p class='c010'>The threat they imposed on the region was constantly growing.
It had grown lately from the marauding of mere seal ground and
fur poachers, who came down out of the iron fastnesses beyond the
Arctic fringes of Alaska, where they lived hidden in security
beyond the reach of the strong arm of the United States law, into
a murder scourge threatening all human life and property within
reach of their ruthless operations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hitherto, Le Gros had only known them from the tales told by
the native pelt hunters, the men who came down to trade at Fort
Cupar. He knew no more and no less than the rest of the handful
of white folks who peopled the region. The stories he had had to
listen to, for all their corroborative nature, were, he knew, for
the most part founded upon hearsay. He had listened to them. He
always listened to these adventurers. But somehow his gentle,
philosophic mind had left him missing something of the awe and
dread which beset the hearts of the men whose lurid stories took
vivid colour from the stirring emotions which inspired them.</p>

<p class='c010'>But now, now he was wide awake to the reality of the terror he
had so largely attributed to superstitious exaggeration. Now he
knew that no story he had ever listened to could compare with the
reality. He was gazing upon a scene of hideous murder and wanton,
savage destruction that utterly beggared description.</p>

<p class='c010'>His feelings were torn to shreds, and his heart cried out in
agony of helpless pity.</p>

<p class='c010'>These poor benighted folk, these simple, peaceful Eskimo,
amiable, industrious, yearning only for the betterment he was
able by his simple ministrations to bring into their lives. What
were they to claim such barbarity from a savage horde? What had
they? What had they done? Nothing. Simply nothing. They were
fisher-folk who spent their lives in the hunt, asking only to be
left in peace to work out the years of their desperately
hard-lived lives. Now—now they were utterly wiped out, a pitiful
sacrifice to the insensate lust of this mysterious scourge.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Gros thrust his cap from his broad forehead. It was a
gesture of impotent despair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God in Heaven!” he cried, and the words seemed to be
literally wrung from him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It no use to call Him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian’s retort came on the instant. And his tone was
harshly ironical.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What I tell you plenty time,” he went on sharply. “The great
God. He look down. He see this thing. He do nothing. No. It this
way. Man do this. Yes. Man do this. Man must punish this dam
Euralian. I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The missionary turned from the slaughter ground. He searched
the Indian’s broad, dusky face. It was a striking face,
high-boned and full of the eagle keenness of the man’s Sioux
Indian forbears. He was a creature of enormous stature, lean,
spare and of tremendous muscle. For all he was civilized, for all
he was educated, this devoted servant lacked nothing of the
savage which belonged to his red-skinned ancestors.</p>

<p class='c010'>Servant and master these two comrades in a common cause stood
in sharp contrast. Usak was a savage and nothing could make him
otherwise. Usak was a man of fierce, hot passions. The other, the
whiteman, except for his great stature, was in direct antithesis.
The missionary was moulded in the gentlest form. He was no
priest. He represented no set denomination of religion. He was a
simple man of compassionate heart who had devoted his life to the
service of his less fortunate fellow creatures where such service
might help them towards enlightenment and bodily and spiritual
comfort.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been five years on his present mission at Fox Bluff. He
had come there of his own choice supported by the staunch
devotion of a young wife who was no less prepared to sacrifice
herself. But now he stood almost alone, but not quite. For though
death had swiftly robbed him of a wife’s devotion, it had left
him with the priceless possession they had both so ardently
yearned. The motherless Felice was at home now in the care of
Pri-loo, the childless wife of Usak, who had gladly mothered the
motherless babe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even as he gazed into the Indian’s furious eyes Le Gros’ mind
had leaped back to his home at Fox Bluff. A sudden fear was
clutching at his heart. Oh, he knew that Fox Bluff was far away
to the east and south. He knew that the journey thither from the
spot where they stood was a full seven days’ of hard paddling on
the great river behind them. But Pri-loo and his infant child
were alone in his home. They were utterly without protection
except for the folk at the near-by Fort. And these Euralians, if
they so desired, what was to stop them with the broad highway of
the river which was open to all?</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook his head endeavouring to stifle the fears that had
suddenly beset him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re wrong, Usak,” he said quietly. “God sees all. He will
punish—in his own good time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak’s fierce eyes snapped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You say that? Oh, yes. You say that all the time, boss,” he
cried. “I tell you—no. You my good boss. You mak me man to know
everything so as a whiteman knows. You show me all thing. You
teach me. You mak me build big reindeer farm so I live good, an’
Pri-loo eat plenty all time. Oh yes. I read. I write. I mak
figgers. You mak me do this thing. You, my good boss. I mak for
you all the time. I big heart for you. That so. But no. I tell
you—No! The great God not know this thing. He not know this
Euralian wher’ he come from. No. Not no more as you he know this
thing. But I know. I—Usak. I know ’em all, everything.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At another time the missionary would have listened to the
man’s quaint egoism with partly shocked amusement. His final
statement, however, startled him out of every other feeling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know the hiding-place of these—fiends?” he demanded
sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak nodded. A curious vanity was shining in the dark eyes
which looked straight into the whiteman’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know him—yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve never told a thing of this before?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was doubt in the missionary’s tone, and in the regard of
his brown eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know him,” Usak returned shortly. Then, in a moment, he
flung out his great hands in a vehement gesture. “I say I know
him—an’ we go kill ’em all up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>All doubt was swept from the missionary’s mind. He understood
the passionate savagery underlying the Indian’s veneer of
civilization. The man was in desperate earnest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.” Le Gros’ denial came sharply. Then his gaze drifted back
to the scene of destruction, and a deep sigh escaped him. “No,”
he reiterated simply. “This is not for us. It is for the police.
If you know the hiding-place of these—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No good, boss. No,” Usak cried, in fierce disappointment.
“The p’lice? No. They so far.” He held up one hand with two
fingers thrusting upwards. “One—two p’lice by Placer. An’ Placer
many days far off. No good.” He shrugged his great shoulders. “Us
mans all dead. Yes. Pri-loo all dead. Felice dead, too. All mans
dead when p’lice come. I know. You not know. You good man. You
not think this thing. Usak bad man Indian. He think this thing
all time. Listen. I tell you, boss, my good boss. I say the thing
in my mind. The thing I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He broke off and glanced in the direction of the river, and
his eyes dwelt on the gently rocking canoe. He turned again, and
his thoughtful eyes came once more to the scene of horror that
infuriated his savage heart. He was like a man preparing to face
something of desperate consequence. Something that might
grievously disturb the relations in which he stood to the man to
whom he believed himself to owe everything he now treasured in
life. At last his hands stirred. They were raised, and moved
automatically under emotions which no words of his were adequate
to express.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I big trail man,” he began. “I travel far. I go by the big
ice, by the big hills, by the big water. I mak trade with all
mans Eskimo. I mak big reindeer trade with him Eskimo, same as
you show me, boss. So I go far, far all time. So I know this
Euralian better as ’em all. I not say. Oh, no. It not good. Now I
say. This mans Euralian look all time for all thing. Furs? Yes.
They steal ’em furs, an’ kill ’em up all Eskimo. So Eskimo all
big scare. Gold? Yes. They look for him all same, too. Oil? Yes.
Coal? Yes. All this thing they look, look for all time. Him mans
not Eskimo. They not Indian. They not whiteman. No. They damn
foreign devil so as I not know. Him all mans live in whiteman
house all time. Big house. I know. I find him house.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s unease had passed. He was absorbed in the thing he
had to tell. Suddenly after a moment’s pause, he raised a hand
pointing so that his wondering companion turned again to the
spectacle he would gladly have avoided.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Boss, you mak ’em this thing! You mak ’em kill all up!
You!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Gros’ horrified gaze swept back to the face of the accusing
man. The Indian was fiercely smiling. He nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mak ’em this, but you not know. You not know nothing,” he
said in a tone that was almost gentle. “Oh, I say ’em this way,
but I not mean you kill ’em all up. You? No. Listen, boss,” he
went on, coming close up and lowering his harsh tones. “You kill
’em all up because you tell all the mans you mak big find gold on
Loon Creek. Boss, you tell the mans. You think all mans good like
so as you. So you not hide this thing. You tell ’em, an’ you show
big piece gold—two. Now you know how you kill ’em all up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak waited. The amazement in the eyes of the missionary gave
place to a grave look of understanding.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean that my story of the discovery of gold I made has
caused—this?” He shook his head, and the question in his mild
eyes was urgent. “How? Tell me, Usak, and tell it quick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it easy. Yes. You tell the story. It go far. It go quick.
All mans know it. Gold! The good boss, Le Gros, find gold! Him
Euralian. Ears, eyes, they all time everywhere. Him hear, too.
Maybe him <em>see</em>, too. I not say. Him mak big think. Him
say: ‘This man, this good boss, him find gold! How we get it? How
we rob him, an’ steal ’em all up gold! Euralian think. It easy.
Le Gros good man. Us go. Us kill ’em all up him Mission. One
Mission. Two Mission. All Mission. Then us go kill up all mans at
Fort Cupar. Kill up Marty Le Gros an’ Usak. Then we get ’em all
this gold.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was fierce conviction in every word the man said. For
all the crudeness of his argument, if argument it could be
called, the force of his convictions carried weight even with a
man who was normally devoid of suspicion. Then, too, there was
still the horror of the spectacle in the clearing to yield its
effect. But greater than all the other’s conviction or argument,
greater than all else, was the missionary’s surge of terror for
the safety of his little baby daughter with her nurse back there
in his home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Gros breathed deeply. His dark eyes were full of the
gravest anxiety. For the moment he had forgotten everything but
the personal danger he had suddenly realised to be
threatening.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak was watching him. He understood the thing that was
stirring behind the whiteman’s troubled eyes. He had driven home
his conviction and he was satisfied. Now he awaited agreement
with his desire that they should themselves go and deal with
these fierce marauders. He saw no reason for hesitation. He saw
nothing in his desire that could make it impossible, hopeless.
But then he was a savage and only applied calm reason when
passion left him undisturbed. The only thing to satisfy his
present mood was to go, even singlehanded if necessary, and
retaliate slaughter for slaughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally it was he again who broke the silence. The spirit
driving him would not permit of long restraint.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Us go, boss?” he urged.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros suddenly bestirred himself. He shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said. Then he pointed at the scene in front of
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We do this thing. The poor dead things must be hidden up.
They were Christians, and we must give them Christian burial.
After that we go. We go back home. There is my little Felice.
There is your Pri-loo. They must be made safe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s decision was irrevocable. The Indian recognised the
tone and understood. But his disappointment was intense.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Us not go?” he cried. His words were accompanied by a sound
that was like a laugh, a harsh, derisive laugh. “So,” he said.
“We bury ’em all these people. Yes. The good boss say so. Then we
go home, an’ mak safe Felice. We mak safe Pri-loo. Then us all
get kill up—sure.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div>THE PLANNING OF LE GROS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was still broad daylight for all the lateness
of the hour. At this time of year darkness was unknown on the
Hekor River. The sky was brilliant, with its cloudless summer
blue shining with midday splendour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros was standing in the doorway of his log-built
home, a home of considerable dimensions and comfort for his own
hands, and those gentle hands of his dead wife, had erected every
carefully trimmed log of it. He had only that day returned, sick
at heart with the hideous recollection of the tragedy of his
far-off Mission.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was gazing out over the bosom of the sluggish river, so
broad, so peacefully smiling as it stole gently away on its
never-ending task of feeding the distant lake whose demands upon
it seemed quite insatiable. His mind was gravely troubled, and it
was planning the thing which had so suddenly become imperative.
In a moment it seemed all the peace, all the quiet delight of his
years of ardent labour amongst the Eskimo had been utterly rent
and dispelled. He had been caught up in the tide of Usak’s savage
understanding of the position of imminent danger in which he and
all his belongings were standing. The thing he contemplated must
be done, and done at once.</p>

<p class='c010'>The evening hour, for all its midday brilliance, was no less
peaceful than the hours of sundown in lower latitudes. He had
learned to love every mood of this far northern world from its
bitter storms of winter to the tropical heat of its fly and
mosquito-ridden summer. It was the appeal of the remote silence
of it all; it was the breadth of that wide northern world so far
beyond the sheer pretences of civilization; it was the freedom,
the sense of manhood it inspired. Its appeal had never once
failed him even though it had robbed him of that tender
companionship of the woman whose only thought in the world had
been for him and his self-sacrificing labours.</p>

<p class='c010'>At another time, with the perfect content of a mind at ease,
he would have stood there smoking his well-charred pipe
contemplating the beauty of this world he had made his own. But
all that was changed now. The beauty, the calm of it all, only
aggravated his moody unease.</p>

<p class='c010'>Beyond the mile-wide river the western hills rose up to dizzy,
snow-capped heights. Their far off slopes were buried under the
torn beds of ages-old glacial fields, or lay hidden behind the
dark forest-belts of primordial growth. The sight of them urged
him with added alarm. He was facing the west, searching beyond
the Alaskan border, and somewhere out there, hidden within those
scarce trodden fastnesses lay the pulsing heart of the thing he
had suddenly come to fear. Usak had warned him. Usak had
convinced him on the seven day paddle down the river. So it was
that those far-off ramparts, with their towering serrated crowns
lost in the heavy mists enshrouding them, no longer appealed in
their beauty. Their appeal had changed to one of serious
dread.</p>

<p class='c010'>He avoided them deliberately. His gaze came back to the nearer
distance of the river, and just beyond it where the old
fur-trading post, which gave its name to the region, stood out
dark and staunch as it had stood for more than a century. A heavy
stockade of logs, which the storms of the years had failed to
destroy, encompassed it. The sight of the stockade filled him
with a satisfaction it had never inspired before. He drew a deep
breath. Yes, he was glad because of it. He felt that those old
pelt hunters had built well and with great wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the wide river slipping away so gently southward. It was
the road highway of man in these remotenesses, passing along just
here between low foreshores of attenuated grasses and
lichen-covered boulders, lit by the blaze of colour from myriads
of tiny Arctic flowers. It was very, very beautiful. But its
beauty was of less concern now than another thought. Just as it
was a possible approach for the danger he knew to be threatening,
so it was the broad highway of escape should necessity
demand.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the time Le Gros was no longer the missionary. He was no
less a simple adventurer than those others who peopled the
region. Spiritual things had no longer place in his thought.
Temporal matters held him. His motherless child was there behind
him in his home in the care of the faithful Pri-loo.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gold! He wondered. What was the curse that clung to the dull
yellow creation of those fierce terrestrial fires? A painful
trepidation took possession of him as he thought of the
tremendous richness of the discovery which the merest chance had
flung into his hands. It had seemed absurd, curiously absurd,
even at the time. He had had no desire for any of it. He had not
yielded himself to the hardship and self-sacrifice of the life of
a sub-Arctic missionary and retained any desire for the things
which gold would yield him. Perhaps for this very reason an
ironical fate had forced her favours upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been well-nigh staggered at the wealth of his
discovery, and he had laughed in sheer amazed amusement that of
all people such should fall to his lot. The discovery had been
his alone. Not even Usak had shared in it. There had been no
reason for secrecy, so he had been prepared to give the story of
it broadcast to the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had shown his specimens, and he had enjoyed the mystery
with which he had enshrouded his discovery when he displayed them
to Jim McLeod, the factor at Fort Cupar, and a small gathering of
trailmen. This had been at first. And chance alone had saved him
from revealing the locality of his discovery. It came in a flash
when he had witnessed the staggering effect which the two great
nuggets he offered for inspection had had upon his audience. In
that moment he had realised something of the potentiality of the
thing that was his.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instantly re-action set in. Instantly he was himself
transformed. The missionary fell from him. He remembered his baby
girl, and became at once a plain adventurer and—father. Someday
Felice would grow to womanhood. Someday he would no longer be
there to tend and care for her. What could he give her that she
might be freed from the hardships waiting upon a lonely girl in a
world that had so little of comfort and sympathy to bestow upon
the weak? Nothing. So, when they pressed him for the locality
whence came his discovery, he—deliberately lied.</p>

<p class='c010'>More than ever now was he concerned for his secret. More than
ever was he concerned for the thing which the savage
understanding of Usak had instilled into his simple mind. His
secret must be safeguarded at once. Whatever the future might
have in store for him personally he must make safe this thing
for—little Felice.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sound came to him from within the house. It was the movement
of the moccasined feet of Usak’s woman, Pri-loo. He spoke over
his shoulder without leaving the doorway.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does she sleep, Pri-loo?” he inquired in a low voice. The
answer came in the woman’s deep, velvet tones.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She sleep, boss.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man bestirred himself. He turned about, and the woman’s
dusky beauty came under his urgent gaze.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I go,” he said. “I’m going right over to see Jim McLeod,
at the Fort. You just sit around till Usak comes back from the
farm. You won’t quit this doorway till he comes along. That so?
I’ll be back in a while, anyway. Felice’ll be all right? You’ll
see to it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes. Sure. Felice all right. Pri-loo not quit. No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was smiling confidence and assurance in the woman’s wide
eyes, so dark and gentle, yet so full of the savage she really
was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good.” Marty Le Gros reached out his hand and patted the
woman’s rounded shoulder under the elaborately beaded buckskin
tunic she had never abandoned for the less serviceable raiment of
the whitewoman. “Then I go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The missionary nodded and passed out. And the squaw stood in
his place in the doorway gazing after him as he hurried down to
the canoe which lay moored at the river bank.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The scene about the Fort was one of leisurely activity. The
day’s work was nearly completed for all the sun was high in the
heavens. The smoke of camp fires was lolling upon the still
evening air, and the smell of cooking food pervaded the entire
neighbourhood.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now the store had emptied of its human, bartering freight, and
with the close of the day’s trading, Jim McLeod and his young
wife, like all the rest, were about to retire to their evening
meal.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was leaning on the long counter contemplating the
narrow day book in which he recorded his transactions with the
Eskimo, and those other trailmen who were regular customers. His
wife, Hesther, young, slight and almost pretty, was standing in
the open doorway regarding the simple camp scenes going on within
the walls of the great stockade which surrounded their home. She
was simply clad in a waist and skirt of some rough plaid
material. Her soft brown eyes were alight and smiling, and their
colour closely matched the wealth of brown hair coiled neatly
about her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nearly through, Jim?” she inquired after awhile.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man at the counter looked up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It ain’t so bad as it’s been,” he said. “But it’s short. A
hell of a piece short of what it should be.” He moved out from
behind his counter and came to the woman’s side. “You know, Hes,
I went into things last night. We’re three hundred seals down on
the year and I’d hate to tell you the number of foxes we’re
short. We’re gettin’ the left-overs. That’s it. Those darn
Euralians skin the pore fools of Eskimo out of the best, an’ we
get the stuff they ain’t no use for. It’s a God’s shame, gal. If
it goes on ther’s jest one thing in sight. We’ll be beatin’ it
back to civilization, an’ chasing up a grub stake. The company’ll
shut this post right down—sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man glanced uneasily about him. His pale blue eyes were
troubled as he surveyed the shelves laden with gaudy trading
truck, and finally came to rest on the small pile of furs baled
behind the counter ready for the storeroom. He understood his
position well enough. He held it by results. The Fur Valley
Trading Company was no philanthropic institution. If Fort Cupar
showed no profit then Fort Cupar, so far as their enterprise was
concerned, would be closed down.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was worried. He knew that a time was coming in the
comparatively near future when Hesther would need all the comfort
and ease that he could afford her. If the Company closed down as
it had been threatening him, it would, he felt, be something in
the nature of a tragedy to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman smiled round into his somewhat fat face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t you feel sore, Jim,” she said in her cheerful
inspiriting way. “Maybe the Good God hands us folk out our
trials, but I guess He’s mighty good in passing us compensations.
Our compensation’s coming along, boy. An’ I’m looking forward to
that time so I don’t hardly know how to wait for it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim’s blue eyes wavered before the steadfast encouragement in
his wife’s confident, slightly self-conscious smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he said, and turned away again to the inadequate pile
of furs that troubled him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nature had been less than kind to Jim McLeod. His body was
ungainly with fat for all his youth. His face was puffy and
almost gross, which the habit of clean shaving left painfully
evident. In reality the man was keen and purposeful. He was
kindly and intensely honest. His one serious weakness, the thing
that had driven him to join up with the hard life of the northern
adventurers was an unfortunate and wholly irresistible addiction
to alcohol. In civilization he had failed utterly for that reason
alone, and so, with his young wife, he had fled from temptation
whither he hoped and believed his curse would be unable to follow
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see, Jim,” Hesther went on reassuringly, “if they close
us down, what then? I guess we’ll be only little worse off.
They’ve got to see us down to our home town, and we can try
again. We—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man interrupted her with a quick shake of the head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t quit this north country,” he said definitely. “Ther’s
things here if we can only hit ’em. And besides it’s my only
chance. An’, Hes, it’s your only chance—with me. You know what I
mean, dear.” He nodded. “Sure you do, gal. It means drink an’
hell—down there. It means—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl laughed happily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Have you escaped it here, Jim?” She shook her head. “But I
don’t worry so I have you. You’re mine. You’re my husband,” she
went on softly. “God gave you to me, an’ whatever you are, or do,
why I guess I’d rather have you than any good angel man who lived
on tea and pie-talk. Please God you’ll quit the drink someday.
You can’t go on trying like you do without making good in the
end. But even if you didn’t—well, you’re just mine anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim smiled tenderly into his wife’s up-turned face. And he
stooped and kissed the pretty, ready lips. And somehow half his
trouble seemed to vanish with the thought of the beautiful mother
heart that would so soon be called upon to exercise its natural
functions. This frail, warm-hearted, courageous creature was his
staunch rock of support. And her simple inspiriting philosophy
was the hope which always urged him on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s fine, my dear,” he said. “You’re the best in the
world, but you can’t conjure furs so we can keep this darn old
ship afloat. But it don’t do to think that way. We’ll jest think
of that baby of ours that’s comin’ an’ do our best, an’—Say!” He
broke off pointing through the doorway and beyond the gateway of
the great stockade in the direction of the river. “Ther’s Marty
comin’ along up from the river—and—he’s in one hell of a
hurry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl turned at once, her gaze following the pointing
finger. The great figure of the missionary was hastily
approaching. The sight of his hurry was sufficiently unusual to
impress them both.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t know he’d got back.” Hesther’s tone was
thoughtful.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He wasn’t due back for two weeks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is there—? Do you think—?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess ther’s something worrying sure. He don’t—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man broke off and placed an arm about the woman’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say best run along, Hes, an’ see about food. I’ll ask him to
eat with us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The wife needed no second bidding. She understood. She nodded
smilingly and hurried away.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The two men were standing beside the counter. Jim McLeod had
his broad back turned to it, and his fat hands, stretched out on
either side of him, were gripping the over-hanging edge of it.
His pale eyes were gazing abstractedly out through the doorway
searching the brilliant distance beyond the river, while a surge
of vivid thought was speeding through his brain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros was intent upon his friend. His dark eyes were
riveted upon the fleshy features of the man upon whom he knew he
must depend.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a silence between them now. It was the silence which
falls and endures only under the profoundest pre-occupation. The
store in which they stood, the simple frame structure set up on
the ruins of the old-time Fort, which it had displaced, was
forgotten. The lavish stock of trading truck, the diminished pile
of furs. Neither had cognizance of the things about them. They
were concerned only with the thing which Marty had told of. The
desperate slaughter, the destruction of his Mission, seven days
higher up the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>After awhile Jim stirred. His gaze came back to the
surroundings in which they stood. He glanced over the big room
with its boarded walls, adorned here and there with fierce,
highly-coloured showcards which he had fastened up to entertain
his simple customers. His wavering eyes paused at the great iron
stove which in winter made life possible. They passed on and
finally rested on the simple modern doorway through which his
young wife had not long passed on her way to prepare food. Here
they remained, for he was thinking of her and of their baby so
soon to be born. Finally he yielded his hold on the counter and
turned on the man who had told of the horror he had so recently
witnessed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s bad, Marty,” he said in a low tone. “It’s so bad it’s
got me scared. Why? Why? Say, it don’t leave me guessing. Does it
you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked searchingly into the steady, dark eyes of the man he
had come to regard above all others.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he went on emphatically. “You’re not guessing. They’ve
heard of your gold—these cursed Euralians. This is their way of
doin’ things sure. They’ll be along down on us—next.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The door opened at the far end of the store. Hesther stood for
a moment framed in the opening. She gazed quickly at the two men,
and realised something of the urgency under which they were
labouring. In a moment she forced a smile to her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Supper’s fixed, Jim,” she said quietly. “Marty’ll join
us—sure. Will you both come right along?”</p>

    <div>TWO MEN OF THE NORTH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“Guess we got an hour to talk, Marty. Hesther
won’t be through her chores in an hour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Gros nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your Hesther’s a good soul, and I’d hate to scare her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. That’s how I feel. I make it you’ve a heap of trouble
back of your head.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The missionary settled himself more comfortably in the hard
chair he had turned from the supper table. He had set it in the
shade of the printed cotton curtain that adorned the parlor
window.</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim McLeod was less concerned for the glaring evening
sunlight. He sat facing it, bulking clumsily on a chair a size
too small for him. His pale blue eyes gazed out of the window
which was closely barred with mosquito-netting.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last of the supper things had been cleared from the table,
and the sounds penetrating the thin, boarded walls of the room
told of the labours of the busy housewife going on in the lean-to
kitchen beyond. There was no need for these added labours which
Hesther inflicted upon herself. There were native women who
worked about the store quite capable of relieving her. But
Hesther understood that the men wanted to talk in private.</p>

<p class='c010'>Besides, it was her happy philosophy that God made woman to
care for the creature comforts of her man, and to relegate that
duty, all those duties connected therewith, would be an offence
which nothing could condone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Gros removed his pipe from his mouth. His eyes were full of
reflective unease.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he reiterated, “and I guess it’s trouble enough to
scare more than a woman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He thrust a hand into a pocket of his coat. He pulled out a
little canvas bag and unfastened the string about its top. He
peered at the yellow fragmentary contents. It was of several
ounces of gold dust, that wonderful alluvial dust ranging in size
from sheer dust to nuggets the size of a schoolboy’s marbles.</p>

<p class='c010'>He passed the bag across to the trader.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get a look at that,” he said. “It’s the wash-up of a single
panning. Just one. I only showed you the two big nuggets
before—when I—lied to you where I made the ‘strike.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lied? You didn’t get it on Loon Creek?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim took possession of the bag of dust. He peered into its
golden depths. And the man observing him noted the keen lighting
of his eyes, and the instant, absorbed interest that took
possession of him. After a moment the trader looked up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One panning?” he demanded incredulously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One panning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim drew a deep breath. It was an expression of that curious
covetous thrill at the sight of unmeasured wealth which is so
human. He weighed the bag in his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ther’s more than three ounces of stuff here,” he said, gazing
into the dark eyes opposite him. “Guess it’s nearer four.” Again
he breathed deeply. “One panning!” he exclaimed. Then followed an
ejaculation which said far more than any words.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You reckon it’s this bringing them down—our way,” he said.
“That’s what Usak reckons, too. Maybe I feel you’re both
right—now. I was a fool to give my yarn out. I should have held
it tight, and just let you know quietly. Yes, I see it now. You
see, I didn’t think. I guess I didn’t understand the temptation
of it. When I lit on that ‘strike’ it scarcely interested me a
thing, and I didn’t see why it should worry anybody else. I
forgot human nature. No, it wasn’t till the gold spirit suddenly
hit me that I realised anything. And when it did it made me
lie—even to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim twisted up the neck of the bag and re-set the lashings
about it. Then, with a regretful sigh, he passed the coveted
treasure back to its owner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Let’s see. How long is it since you handed out your yarn?
It’s more’n two months. Two months,” he repeated thoughtfully.
“They’ve had two months on Loon Creek, an’ they’ve drawn blank.
There—Yes, I see. They’re coming back on you. They started by way
of your Mission, an’ they mean you to git a grip on their way of
handlin’ the thing. Man, it sets my blood red hot. They’ve
cleaned this region out of furs, an’ every other old trade, so
I’m sittin’ around waitin’ for my people to close us down, and
now—this. Is there no help? Ain’t ther’ a thing we can do? God!
It makes me hot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The blue eyes were fiercely alight. There was no wavering in
them now. Passionate desire to fight was stirring in the trader.
And somehow his emotion seemed to rob his body of its appearance
of physical ungainliness.</p>

<p class='c010'>The missionary seemed less disturbed as he set the bag back in
his pocket. He had passed through his bad time. Now his decision
was taken. Now he was no longer the missionary but a simple man
of single purpose which he intended to put through in such way as
lay within his power, aided by the friendship of Jim McLeod.</p>

<p class='c010'>A shadowy smile lit his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. It’s the gold now,” he said, with an expressive gesture.
“But,” he went on, with a shake of the head, “for the life of me
I can’t get behind the minds of these mysterious northern—devils.
Why, why in the name of all that’s sane and human should these
Euralians descend on a pitiful bunch of poor, simple fisher-folk,
and butcher and burn them off the face of the earth? It’s
senseless, inhuman barbarity. Nothing else. If they want my
secret, if they want the truth I denied to you as well as the
rest, it’s here, in my head,” he said, tapping his broad forehead
with a forefinger. “Not out there with those poor dead creatures
who never harmed a soul on God’s earth. If they want it they must
come to me. And when they come they—won’t get it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was transformed. Not for a moment had he raised his
voice to any tone of bravado or defiance. Cold decision was
shining in his eyes and displayed itself in the clip of his jaws
as he returned his pipe to his mouth. Jim waited. His moment of
passionate protest had passed. He was absorbed in that which he
felt was yet to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, listen, Jim,” Le Gros went on, after the briefest
pause, with a sharp intake of breath which revealed something of
the reality of the emotions he was labouring under. “You’re my
good friend, and I want to tell you things right here and now,
to-night. That’s why I came over in a hurry. You’ve always known
me as a missionary. The man in me was kind of lost. That’s so.
But now you’ve got to know me as a man. You were the first I told
of my ‘strike.’ You were the first I showed those nuggets to. And
you guessed they were worth five thousand dollars between
’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All o’ that. Maybe ten thousand dollars.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim’s fleshy lips fondled the words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I showed you that stuff I was the missionary. The thing
began to fall off when I watched you looking at them. But it
wasn’t till some of the trailmen, and even the Indians, heard the
story, and showed their amazing lust for the thing I’d
discovered, that I got a full grip on all that yellow stuff
meant. Then I forgot to be a missionary and was just a man the
same as they were. I was startled, shocked. I was half scared. I
saw at a glance I’d made a bad break in telling my story, and so,
when you all asked me the whereabouts of the strike, I—lied.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He paused, passing a hand over his forehead, and smoothed back
his ample black hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ it wasn’t Loon Creek?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim smiled as he put his question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m glad,” he added as the other shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re glad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I surely am.” Jim spread out his hands. “Here, Marty,” he
cried, “I was sick to death hearing you hand out your yarn to the
boys. I kind of saw a rush for Loon Creek comin’ along and
beating you—an’ me—right out of everything. Knowing you I thought
it was truth. But I’m mighty glad you—lied.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Gros sat back in his chair. His eyes turned from the man
before him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Knowing me?” he said, with a gentle smile of irony. “I
wonder.” He shook his head. “I didn’t know myself. No, you didn’t
know me. I’m different now. Quite different. And it’s that gold
changed me. Do you know how—why? No.” He shook his head. “I guess
you don’t. I’ll tell you. It’s Felice. My little Felice. And
that’s why I came right over to see you, and tell you the things
in my mind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim shifted his chair as the other paused. He leant forward
with his forearms resting on his knees. The thought of the gold
was deep in his mind. There was personal, selfish interest in him
as well as interest for that which the other had to tell him
about his baby, Felice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty drew a deep breath. His eyes turned from the man before
him. The intensity of Jim’s regard left him with an added
realisation of the power that gold exercises over the simplest,
the best of humanity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I live, Jim, I’m going to let you into this ‘strike.’
Maybe it’ll help you, and leave you free of your Company,” he
said gently. “You shall be in it what you folk call
‘fifty-fifty.’ If I die you shall be in it the same way, only
it’ll be with my baby girl. And for that I want to set an
obligation on you. Can you stand for an obligation?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anything for you, Marty,” Jim replied at once, and earnestly.
“Anything for you,” he repeated. “And I’ll put it through with
the last breath of life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good.” The missionary’s gaze came back to the trader’s face,
and a smiling relief shone in his eyes. He nodded. “You see, with
these wretched Euralians on the war path, and with me standing
around in their path, you can never tell. Maybe I’ll live. Maybe
I won’t. If I live you’ll be up to your neck in this ‘strike’
anyway. If I die you’ll work it for Felice, and hand her her
‘fifty’ of it when the time comes. Is it good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s so good I can’t tell you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you swear to do this, Jim? Will you swear on—on the
thing you hold most sacred?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll swear it on the little life that’s just goin’ to be born
to Hesther an’ me. If a thing happens to you, Marty, so you lose
the daylight, your little Felice shall be seen right, and all you
can wish for her shall be done, though you never tell me a thing
of this ‘strike.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>The simple honesty looking out of Jim’s eyes eased the
troubled heart of the older man. He nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew it would be that way. I’m glad,” he said. “I’m not
passing you thanks. No thanks could tell you the thing you’ve
made me feel, Jim.” He laughed shortly. “Thanks? I guess it would
be an insult when a boy like you is ready to set himself to
carrying the whole of another feller’s burden.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again he passed a hand over his hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is how I’ve planned, Jim,” he went on, after a moment.
“I’m going right back home now, and I’m going to pass some hours
drawing out the plan and general map of the ‘strike.’ I’ll write
it out in the last detail. Then I’ll set it in a sealed packet
and hand it to you. You’ll have it, and keep it, and you won’t
open it while I’m alive. It’s just so the thing shan’t be lost if
they kill me up. See? If I live we’ll work this thing together at
‘fifty-fifty.’ That way there won’t be need for you to open up
those plans. Do you get it? The whole thing is just a precaution
for you and my little Felice. You see, if I pass over I’ve
nothing else to hand that poor little kiddie. It’s her bit of
luck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim sat back in his chair and began to refill his pipe which
had gone out. For some moments his stirring emotions prevented
speech, while the smiling eyes of the missionary watched his
busy, clumsy fingers. At last, however, he looked up. And as he
did so he thrust the tobacco hard into the bowl of his pipe, and
the force of his action was no less than the headlong rush of
words that surged to his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, it’s Hell! Simple Hell!” he cried passionately. “What
have we done that we should be cursed by these murdering
Euralians. They’re not going to get you, Marty. We’ve got to fix
that. Come right over here. Quit your shanty, an’ bring Felice,
an’ Pri-loo, an’ Usak right over here. It’s no sort of swell
place, this old frame house the Company’s set up for me. But the
stockade outside it stands firm twelve feet high right around.
And I’ve guns an’ things plenty to defend it. I can corral plenty
trailmen who’d be glad enough to scrap these folk, and we could
fight ’em an’ beat ’em, till we get help from Placer where the
p’lice can collect a posse of ‘specials.’ We’re not goin’ to sit
down under this thing. It’s not my way. An’ it’s not goin’ to be
your way. We’ll fight. Come right over to-morrow, Marty. We’ll
just be crazy for you to come, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Le Gros interrupted him with a gesture.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right boy,” he said. “I know just how you feel and
I’m glad. But you don’t know the thing you’re trying to bring on
your Hesther, and your unborn baby. You haven’t seen the thing
I’ve seen. You haven’t seen old men and women, butchered and
mutilated, lying stark on the ground. You haven’t seen babes
scattered around legless, armless, headless. And the young men
and young women—gone.” He shook his head, and the horror of
recollection was in his eyes. “No. You haven’t seen those things,
and you haven’t remembered that I carry this curse about with me.
Sheltering here I bring it to your door. To you, and your
Hesther, and your babe. With me across the river there you’re
free and safe. No. I stand or fall by my wits, my luck, my own
efforts. You are doing for me the only thing I ask in
safeguarding my secret and caring for little Felice. That’s what
I ask. And you’ve promised me. That’s all, Jim, my friend, and
now I’ll get along back and fix those plans.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose from his chair, tall, strong and completely calm. And
the trader rose, too, and gazed up into the other’s face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll take all those chances, Marty,” he said
deliberately.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And Hesther?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And my unborn baby. Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros thrust out his hand and the two men gripped.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re a good friend, Jim. But my mind’s made up. While I’ve
life I’ll fight my own fight. When I’m dead please God you’ll
do—what I can’t. So long Jim,” he added wringing the fleshy hand
he was still gripping. “I’ll be along over with those plans
before you eat your breakfast.”</p>

    <div>THE LUCK OF THE KID</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The brilliant June night was like a midsummer day.
The deathless sun knew no rest for all the Arctic world was wrapt
in slumber. The stillness of it all, the perfect quiet; it was a
world of serene solitude, with only the sounds which came from
unseen creatures, and the rustle of stirred vegetation caught on
a gentle zephyr, to whisper of the life prevailing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros was back in his own home. He was at the little
table which served him for such writing as his work as missionary
entailed. It was a simple apartment characteristic of the
habitation he had set up. The walls were plastered with a
dun-coloured mud smoothed down but retaining all its crudeness
which nothing could disguise. The room was of considerable
extent. Its furnishing was no less primitive than its walls, but
also no less robust. Every article was of his own design and
manufacture, and that which it lacked in refinement it made up in
substance. Chairs were rawhide-strung, square and solid. The
table had legs of saplings, and a top that was made from packing
cases obtained from Jim McLeod. The ceiling above his head was of
cotton. So were the two windows which were flung open to admit
air through the mosquito netting beyond them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, it was all very crude. Nevertheless it lost nothing of
its sense of home. The floor was strewn with sun-dried furs, and
there were shelves of well-read books. The man’s simple sleeping
bunk was curtained off in one corner near by to the doorway which
communicated with a lesser room where slept his motherless child.
And there was still another doorway which led to a third room. It
was the kitchen place where Usak and Pri-loo slept, and where the
latter prepared such food as was needed.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no sound in the place but that of the man’s
occasional movements and the scratching of the pen with which he
was working. Felice was asleep in the next room in the cot which
he and his dead wife had long since fashioned and adorned.
Pri-loo, awaiting the return of her man from the reindeer farm,
which was his work, had finally yielded her vigil and retired to
her blankets in the kitchen. It was the calving season down at
the farm, and as likely as not Usak would not return to her for
many hours.</p>

<p class='c010'>The missionary had applied himself to his task with that close
concentration which betokened the urgency of his desire. He had
been at work for over an hour. Now he sat with his great body
hunched over the table, and, with poised pen, was at last
regarding his completed work. The large sheet of paper stared
back at his darkly brooding eyes, and the careful tracery on its
surface spread from one end of it to the other. It was the
drawing of a wide, winding river. And along its entire course was
dotted every detail of natural formation which his keen memory
supplied him with. Hills were carefully drawn. Woodland bluffs
were marked with due regard to their extent. Everything that
could serve to guide the explorer was there set out. Every title
for each natural feature was inscribed, and one wide stretch of
river foreshore was outlined in red ink and inscribed with the
words “mouth of creek.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was complete. It was complete with that care and
consideration which spoke of the tremendous anxiety lying behind
the man’s purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he abandoned his scrutiny and a deep sigh escaped him.
Then he leisurely picked up his tobacco bag and began to fill his
pipe. Leaning back in his chair his gaze sought the daylight
beyond the window, and in a moment he became absorbed in
profound, wakeful dreaming and his pipe remained forgotten.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had reached another great crisis in his simple life. He
knew it. He understood to the last detail the ominous
significance of the thing he had just completed. His thought
began by searching ahead, but swiftly it was caught and flung
back into the deep channels of memory such as never fail to claim
when the heart of man is deeply stirred.</p>

<p class='c010'>A wide panorama of the past swept into his view. It began, as
everything seemed to begin with him now, at that time when he and
his young wife had taken their final decision to move northwards
where their spiritual desires could find expression in the
wilderness of untamed Nature. He remembered, how keenly he
remembered, the surge of thrilling anticipation with which they
had embarked on their mission. The bitter hardships they had had
to endure, and the merciless labours that had been theirs to make
even their simple lives possible here on the Hekor River, which
followed so nearly the course of the Arctic Circle. He remembered
the selfless kindness of Jim McLeod and his gentle wife. How they
had helped him with everything that lay in their power. Yes, it
was a happy memory which eased the strain of the thing besetting
him now.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then had come that first great happiness and finally disaster.
Jim was looking forward now to just the same moment in his life.
That first-born child. It was an ineffaceable landmark in the
life of any man.</p>

<p class='c010'>He sighed. He was contemplating again the tragedy which had
followed hard in the wake of his overwhelming happiness. Poor
little Jean. Poor, poor little woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her happiness was short enough lived, and his— In his simple,
earnest fashion he prayed God that Jim and Hesther should never
know a similar disaster. He wondered if little Jean knew of the
thing he was doing now. And if she would have approved had she
been there to witness it. Yes. Somehow he felt that her full
approval would have been his. It was for Felice. He desired
nothing for himself but to be permitted to carry on the labours
of his Mission. But for Felice—</p>

<p class='c010'>He stirred uneasily. The scene of his devastated Mission lit
again before his mental gaze and tortured him. And suddenly he
sat up and carefully folded the annotated map he had prepared. He
finally enclosed it in a piece of American cloth, tied it up
securely, and sealed it with the fragment of wax he had
discovered for that purpose. Then he stood up and gazed about
him. His dark eyes took in every happy detail of the home which
had served him so long. And presently the man of peace found
himself contemplating the cartridge belt, with its two great
revolvers protruding from their holsters, which was hanging from
its nail on the log wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some moments he regarded it without any change of
expression. Then of a sudden he stirred and moved quickly over to
it. He removed first one gun from its holster, then the other. He
examined them. They were old-fashioned, and their chambers were
empty. Very deliberately, almost reluctantly, he loaded them in
each chamber. Then with another sigh he returned them to the
holsters where they belonged.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned away quickly. It was as though he detested the thing
he had just done and was anxious to rid himself of the memory of
it. So he passed into the room which he had always shared with
his wife, but which now was given up to the atom of humanity
which was the priceless treasure of his life.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The man was sitting on the stool set beside the simple bedcot.
It was the stool which Pri-loo was wont to occupy when watching
over the slumbers of the child she had taken to her mother heart.
He was gazing down upon the sleeping babe as she lay there under
the coloured blankets and patch-work quilt which was the
daintiest covering with which he had been able to provide
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fair-haired and sweetly cherubic the child lay breathing in
that calm, almost imperceptible fashion so sure an indication of
perfect health. Her colouring was exquisite. A subtle tracery of
blue veins was plainly visible beneath the delicate, fair skin.
She was sweetly pretty, and her brief four years of life had
afforded her a generous development sufficient to satisfy the
most exacting parent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s dark eyes were infinitely tender as he regarded the
sleeping child. Gold? There was no treasure in the world
comparable with that, which, with her dying effort, his
well-loved wife had presented him. Felice—little Felice. The
smiling, prattling creature, the thought of whose wide blue eyes
was unfailing in lightening even the darkest shadows which the
cares of her father’s life imposed upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He feasted himself now on the beauty which was so like to that
of the mother who had given up her life for his desire. And as he
gazed a surge of deep, tender feeling recalled a hundred happy
memories. And so for awhile he was filled with smiling
thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it passed. It passed with a suddenness that left a cold
dew of fear upon his brow for all the warmth of the Arctic summer
night. For even as memory had transported him to the days wherein
his life had known no shadow, so it had brought him again to the
recollection of the scene of mutilation he had witnessed at his
Mission. There he had seen children, younger even than Felice,
lying upon the ground limbless, headless, almost unrecognisable
trunks.</p>

<p class='c010'>An unconscious movement stirred him, and he shook his head as
though in denial of his thought. Then he gazed down upon the
sealed packet he was carrying in his hand. For long moments he
looked at it, and then, of a sudden, his eyes came back to the
face of the sleeping babe, and words came in a low, tender
whisper.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, kiddie,” he murmured, “not while I have life. My poor
Jean gave you to me, little bit. And you’re just mine. All I am
in the world will defend you from harm such—such as—God! No. Not
that. Psha! No, it couldn’t be.” He wiped his forehead with a
hand that was unsteady. Then he forced a smile to his eyes just
as he forced his fears back and strove to think of the thing he
had spent so many hours preparing. He held up the packet in his
hand before the child’s closed eyes. “This wasn’t sent my way for
nothing,” he whispered. “It’s your luck, little kid. Yours. It’s
for you, half of it. And—and if I should fail—well, there’s
others’ll see you get it. My little kiddie. My little—”</p>

<p class='c010'>He broke off. The man’s tender admonition died on his lips
which closed almost with a snap. His whole attitude underwent a
change. He sat rigid and listening, and his dark eyes were turned
as though seeking to peer over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a sound. A sound that came from beyond the outer room.
It was not from the direction of the kitchen place where Usak
might be returning home. No. It came from beyond the front door
of the shanty which was not the way Usak would come.</p>

<p class='c010'>The missionary made no movement. Every sense was straining,
every faculty was alert. Sounds came in the night. It was a
common enough thing. But he had that in his mind now which gave
to any sound in the night the possibility of a new
interpretation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moments passed. The tension eased. And again the fathers
eyes came back to the face of the sleeping child. But it was only
for an instant. Of a sudden he dropped the sealed packet into the
child’s cot and leapt to his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>Headlong he ran for the open doorway, and the purpose in his
mind was obvious. He passed it, and ran for the loaded guns
hanging upon the wall of his room. But he failed to reach them. A
shot rang out and he stumbled. Putting forth a superhuman effort
he sought to recover himself. But his legs gave under him and he
crashed to the floor with the first tearful cry of his wakened
child ringing in his ears.</p>

    <div>THE EURALIANS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Marty Le Gros lay sprawled on the ground. He had
scarcely moved from the position in which he had fallen. Pri-loo,
her handsome eyes aflame with fierce anger, was standing just
within the doorway leading to the kitchen place. A man stood
guard over her, a small dark-skinned creature whose eyes slanted
with a suggestion of Mongol obliqueness. It was obvious that she
was only held silent under threat of the gun that her guard held
ready. Two other dark-skinned strangers moved about the living
room clearly searching, and a third stood looking on, propped
against the table which served the missionary for writing. Beyond
the movements of the searching men, and such disturbance as the
process of their work entailed, and the insistent cries of the
child Felice in the adjoining room, an ominous silence
prevailed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The expression of the almost yellow eyes of the man at the
table was intense with cold, deliberate purpose. It was without
one gleam of pity for the fallen missionary. It was without
concern for the angry woman held silent in the doorway. He was
regarding only the movements of the men acting under his orders.
He, like the man in charge of Pri-loo, was clad in the ordinary
garb customary to whitemen of the northern trail. But the others,
the searchers, had no such pretensions. They were in the rough
clothing native to the Eskimo when Arctic summer prevails.</p>

<p class='c010'>After awhile the terrified cries of the suddenly awakened
Felice died down to the intermittent sobs which so surely claim
the sympathies of the mother-heart. Even Pri-loo’s fierce native
anger yielded before their appeal. Distress stirred her, and only
the threatening gun held her from rushing to comfort the helpless
babe who was her treasured charge.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great prone figure of the missionary on the ground
stirred. It was the preliminary to returning consciousness. Quite
abruptly his head was raised. Then, by a great effort, he propped
himself on to his elbow and gazed about him. Finally his dark,
troubled eyes came to rest on the face of the still figure of the
man who stood regarding him.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a searching pause while eye met eye. Then the
missionary sought to moisten his lips with a tongue little less
parched.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” he demanded in the low, husky voice of a man whose
strength is rapidly waning.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man at the table turned to the searchers whose task seemed
complete.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing?” he said. And his tone was almost without
question.</p>

<p class='c010'>One of the searchers offered a negative gesture. There was no
verbal reply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man at the table inclined his dark, close-cropped head and
turned again to the man on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re going to tell us of that gold ‘strike,’ Le Gros,” he
said simply, without the slightest sign of foreign or native
accent. “You’re going to tell us right away. Because if you don’t
we’ve a way of making you. Do you get that? You’d better get it.
It’ll be easier for you and for those belonging to you. We’ve
come many miles to hear about that ‘strike,’ and we aren’t
returning empty-handed. Do you fancy handing your story? Or—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll get nothing from me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Marty Le Gros’ voice had suddenly become harsh and furious.
All his ebbing strength was flung into his retort.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man with the cold eyes shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I shall,” he said, with calm decision. “I’m not here to ask
twice. You’ve seen the—remains—of your Mission, ’way up the
river. Doesn’t that tell you about things? It should—if you have
sense.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s threat was the more deeply sinister for the
frigidity of his tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>The missionary’s eyes lit. For all his growing weakness, for
all the suffering the wound in his side was causing him, a tinge
of hot colour mounted to his pallid cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I tell you you’ll get nothing from me,” he said, and the
strength of his voice had ominously lessened. He raised his body
till he was supporting himself on one hand which rested in the
pool of his own life-blood staining the earthen floor. His dark
eyes were fiercely defiant as they gazed up at the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Euralian leader nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll see.” Then he pointed at Pri-loo standing in the
doorway watching the pitiful duel, hardly realising the full
meaning of what she beheld. “You see her? Watch!”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a sign. It was given on the instant. And the dying
man gasped in horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your woman, eh?” The Euralian went on. “Well, she won’t be
any longer. Are you going to—speak?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’s not my woman. She’s the wife of Usak. If—if you harm
her it’s—it’s sheer, wanton—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The words died on the missionary’s lips. There was a sharp
report. It was the gun of the man guarding Pri-loo fired at close
range. It rang out tremendously in the narrow confines of the
room. The foster-mother of Felice was shot through the head,
which was completely shattered. The poor dead creature dropped
where she stood, without a sound, without a cry. To the last
moment of her staunch life her angry eyes had defied her
captors.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dying missionary reeled. He would have fallen again to the
ground. But the searchers were beside him, and they seized and
held him lest he should miss a single detail of that which was
intended for his infliction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are you going to—say about it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Euralian’s eyes lit as he made his taunting demand. The
tearful cries of the terrified Felice were again raised in
response to the deafening report of the gun that had slain her
foster-mother.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Marty Le Gros’ strength was oozing through the wound that
had laid him low. The shock of the hideous massacre of the
helpless Pri-loo was overwhelming. Consciousness was nearing its
extremity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a word.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The retort was whispered. The missionary had no strength for
more.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man at the table bestirred himself. Perhaps he realised
that opportunity was slipping away from him. A swift, imperative
sign to the youth who had slain Pri-loo, and the next moment he
had passed into the room whence came the redoubled cries of the
distracted Felice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The closing eyes of the dying man widened on the instant. A
surge of hopeless terror stared out of their dark depths. His
lolling head was lifted erect and it turned in the direction of
the door through which the Euralian had vanished. In supreme
anguish he realised the thing contemplated. His child! Felice! In
a spasm of recollection he saw again the headless trunks of the
children of his Mission. The man at the table was forgotten. His
own sufferings. Even he had forgotten the thing he was trying to
safeguard. Felice! His babe! They—</p>

<p class='c010'>“If the woman wasn’t yours, Le Gros, the child is,” the man at
the table taunted. “Well? Will you—talk?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The terrible yellow eyes were irresistible. There was no
escape from them. And Marty Le Gros forgot everything but the
anguish which the taunt inspired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not her! Not that!” he cried. “Yes,” he went on urgently.
“You can have it. For God’s sake spare—”</p>

<p class='c010'>He gasped and his head lolled helplessly. But again he
rallied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The plans? The plans you made to-night? Where are they?
Quick!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man at the table had moved. He had approached his victim.
His voice was fiercely urgent for he realised the thing that was
happening.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’re—there,” Marty Le Gros gasped. “They’re—in—her—”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was his supreme effort, and it remained uncompleted. His
words died away in a gasping jumble of sounds that rattled in his
throat. For one brief spasm his arms struggled with the men
supporting him. Then his head lolled forward again, and his body
limpened. A moment later the supporting hands were removed and
Marty Le Gros fell back on the ground—dead.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The yellow eyes of the leader were turned on the young man who
had just re-entered the room bearing in his arms the screaming
Felice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Too late,” he said coldly. “You’ve blundered, Sate. It was
that clumsy shot of yours. Maybe you’ll learn someday. Tcha!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sate dropped the screaming child roughly to the ground. His
black eyes sparkled. There was triumph as well as resentment in
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That so? Oh, yes. Well, here are the plans. He sealed them
when they were finished. We saw that. Eh?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He held out the packet he had found in Felice’s cot, and the
older man accepted it without a sign. In a moment he withdrew a
sheath knife and severed the fastenings. Flinging off the outer
cover he unfolded the contents. A glance was sufficient and he
looked up without a smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Set fire to the place,” he ordered coldly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he glanced down at the dead man. Felice had crawled up
close to the body of her father. Her baby arms were thrust about
his neck as though clinging to him for protection. Or maybe it
was only in that fond baby fashion she had long since learned.
Her cries had wholly ceased. Even in death the comfort of her
father’s presence and proximity were all sufficient to banish her
every terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take her out,” he ordered, without a shadow of softening.
“Set her somewhere near by in the bluff. Maybe the folk across
the river will come along and find her when they see the fire. If
they don’t, well, maybe the—wolves will.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Usak gazed about him in a hopeless amazement. He was standing
before the smoking remains of Marty Le Gros’ Mission. He had
hastened home from the farm which lay several miles away to the
east. In the midst of his work amongst his herd of reindeer he
had suddenly observed the smoke cloud lolling heavily upon the
near horizon, and without a moment’s hesitation he had abandoned
the new-born fawn he was attending to ascertain its cause.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been filled with alarm at the sight. There was nothing
he knew of in the neighbourhood to fire but the bluff that
sheltered the Mission and the house itself. So he had come at
once at a speed that only he could have achieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>His worst fears were realised. It was not the sheltering
bluff. That was still standing. It was the house itself, that
home which had been his shelter as well as that of those
others.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some moments he contemplated the scene without any attempt
at active investigation. It almost seemed as if his keen wit had
somehow become dulled under the shock of his discovery. Just at
first it was the fire itself that pre-occupied. Somehow he did
not associate it with disaster to the occupants. That did not
occur to him. Doubtless at the back of his mind lay the
conviction that the missionary, and Pri-loo, and little Felice
had crossed the river and gone to McLeod’s store for shelter.
That was at first.</p>

<p class='c010'>A light breeze drifted the smoke down upon him. For a moment
he was enveloped in it. Then it passed. A fresh current of wind—a
cross current—drifted it back whence it came, and the man which
the passing of the smoke revealed had somehow been
transformed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Amazement was no longer in his black eyes. They were alight
and burning with a passion of anxiety. That cloud of smoke had
borne upon his sensitive nostrils the smell of burning flesh.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak moved up to the charred walls. They were hot and smoking.
Most of them were in a state of wreckage, for the roof had fallen
and many of the logs had crashed from the tops of the walls. He
passed round them, a swift-moving, silent figure seeking access
where the smouldering fire would permit. The back door of the
kitchen-place was impossible. Flames were still devouring that
which remained. The windows were surrounded with hot, fiery
timbers. The front door giving on to the sitting room alone
seemed possible. But here again was fire, though it had almost
burnt out.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the man’s mood was not such as to leave him standing
before obstacles. In his half savage heart was a native terror of
fire. But just now all that was completely overborne by emotions
that were irresistible. The smell of burning flesh was strong in
his nostrils, he even fancied he could taste something of it on
his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just for one instant he paused before the doorway measuring
the chances of it all. Then he leapt forward and vanished into
the smoking ruin.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Jim McLeod was standing in the doorway of his store. He had
been roused from sleep by a furious hammering on the door. He had
flung on a heavy skin coat over his night clothes and hastily
thrust a gun in each pocket of it. Then he had cautiously
proceeded to investigate, for the memory of his long talk with
Marty Le Gros was still with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But his apprehensions had been swiftly allayed, or at least
changed, for the harsh deep tones of Usak had replied to his
challenge through the barred door.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now he was listening to the thing the Indian had to say and
the horror of the story he listened to found reflection in his
pale blue eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’ve killed ’em an’ burnt ’em out?” he cried incredulously
as the furious man broke off the torrent of the first rush of his
story.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak’s black eyes were aflame with a light that was bordering
on frenzy. The infant Felice, wrapped in a blanket, was in his
arms and clinging to him with her tiny arms about the man’s
trunk-like neck, silent, wide-eyed, but content with a presence
understood and loved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here I tell you. I tell you quick so no time is lost. I work
by the farm all night. So. It is the season when I work that way.
The young deer need me. Oh, yes. So I work. Then I mak look up in
the corral. There is smoke to the west. Smoke. I look some more,
an’ I think quick. Smoke? Fire? What burns that way? Two things,
maybe. The bluff. The house of Marty Le Gros. So I mak quick
getaway. Oh, yes. Very quick. Then I come by the house. It all
burn. Yes. No house. Only burning logs all break up. So I stand
an’ think. An’ while I stand I smell. So. I smell the cooking of
meat. Meat. First I have think Marty an’ Pri-loo mak big getaway
to here. Then, when I smell this thing, I think—no. Not
getaway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They were—burnt?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim’s horror added fuel to the fire of Usak’s surging frenzy.
He nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. They burn. They burn all up. But not so they die. Oh,
no.” The Indian shook his head, and the brooding light in his
black eyes suddenly blazed up afresh. “Listen,” he cried, in his
fierce way. “I tell you. I—Usak. I see him all. I go mad. Oh,
yes. I think of Pri-loo. I think of little Felice. I think of the
good Marty. So I go into the house just wher’ I can. I go by the
door which him burn right out. Then I find ’em. Then I find ’em
all dead. An’ the fire cook ’em lak—meat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The great rough creature thrust the greasy fur cap back from
his forehead. There was sweat on his low brow. But it was the
sweat inspired by his fierce emotions.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned away in desperation, and so his black eyes were
hidden from the search of the trader’s. A curious feeling of
helplessness in the midst of the storm of rage besetting him
threatened overwhelming. There was a moment even when the soft
arms about his neck seemed to be stifling him. But his weakness
passed in a flash. The next moment the furious onslaught of the
savage in him held sway.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the fire not kill him,” he cried, his tone lowered to
something like a snarl of savagery. “I look. I find ’em, Pri-loo.
My woman. I find her, yes, an’ I think I go crazy sure. They kill
her—my woman. My good woman. They shoot her by the head. It all
break up. Oh, yes. My woman. They kill her—dead.” His voice died
out and his black eyes were turned away again to hide that which
looked out of them. But in a moment he went on. “Then I find him.
The good boss, Marty. Him belly all shoot to pieces. Oh, yes.
They kill him all up dead, too. Then I look for Felice. Little
Felice.” His arms tightened about the child nestling against his
shoulder. “No Felice. She all gone. I think maybe they eat her. I
think. I look. No. No Felice. So I go out an’ think some more. I
stand by bluff. Then I find ’em. She mak big cry out. She by the
bluff. So I find her. They throw her in the bush in the blanket
of my woman, Pri-loo.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man paused again and a deep breath said far more of the
thing he was enduring than his words told. After a moment he
nodded his head, and his lank, black hair brushed the fair face
of the child in his arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I bring her, an’ you tak her. You, an’ your good
whitewoman tak her like your own. I go. I find this Euralian
mans. I know ’em wher’ they camp. Oh, yes. Usak big hunter. Shoot
plenty much good. I kill ’em all up dead. They kill ’em my woman,
Pri-loo. My good woman. They kill ’em my good boss, Marty. So I
kill ’em, too. Now I go. You tak Felice. Bimeby I come back when
all Euralian kill dead. Then I tak Felice. I raise her like the
good boss, by the farm. It for her. Yes. That farm. Marty love
little Felice all the time. He mak all good thing for Felice. So
I mak same all good thing, too. That so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim McLeod made no attempt to reply. Somehow it seemed
impossible even to offer comment in face of the terrible story
the man had brought to him, and the simple irrevocable purpose in
his spoken determination. He held out his arms to receive the
murdered man’s child, and Usak, with infinite gentleness,
released himself from the clinging arms so reluctant to part from
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You tak ’em. Yes,” he said as he passed the babe over.
“Bimeby I come back. Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Jim folded the child to his broad bosom in clumsy,
unaccustomed fashion. He was hardly conscious of the thing he
did. His horrified imagination was absorbed by the terrible scene
he was witnessing through the eyes of the Indian. Quite suddenly
his mind leapt back to the thing Marty had intended and had been
at such pains to discuss with him, and his question came on the
instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Everything? Everything was burnt out? There was nothing left?
Books? Papers?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Him all burn up. Oh yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Felice began to cry. In a moment her little chubby hands were
beating her protest against the broad bosom of the trader. The
sight of her rebellion somehow had a softening effect on the
coloured man, and he spoke in a manner and in a tone of
gentleness which must have seemed impossible in him a moment
before.</p>

<p class='c010'>But even his encouragement was without effect. The child’s
cries rose to a fierce, healthly pitch of screaming which
promptly called forth protest from the trail dogs about the camps
within the stockade. For some moments pandemonium reigned, and in
the midst of it the voice of Hesther, who had hurried from her
bed, brought comfort to her helpless husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“For goodness’ sake!” she cried at the sight of the terrified
child in her husband’s arms. “Are you crazy, Jim, havin’ that
pore baby gal—Felice? Little Felice? Say, what—? Here, pass her
to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The trader made no demur. In a moment the distracted child was
exchanged into his wife’s outstretched arms which tenderly
embraced and snuggled her close to her soft motherly bosom.</p>

<p class='c010'>The men looked on held silent by Hesther’s presence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The child’s cries were quickly hushed, and the dogs abandoned
their savage, responsive chorus. Hesther looked searchingly up
into Jim’s troubled face. Then her gentle, inquiring eyes passed
on to scrutinize the face of the Indian.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me,” she demanded. And her words were addressed to Usak,
as she rocked the child to and fro in her arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Usak was reluctant. He averted his gaze while the whiteman
became pre-occupied with the broad expanse of the river beyond
the gateway of the stockade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Something’s happened,” she went on urgently. “What is it?
I’ve got to know. I shall know it later, anyhow, Jim!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The trader shook his head. But it was different with the
Indian. His eyes came back to the woman’s face and he nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. You know him bimeby,” he said quietly. “Maybe your man
tell him all now. I tell him. He know this thing. Yes. Now I go.
I go hunt all him Euralian mans. I find ’em. I kill ’em all up
dead, same lak him kill up Pri-loo, an’ my good boss, Marty. I go
now. Bimeby I come back, an’ I mak all good thing for little
Felice. I not come back, then you mak raise ’em Felice lak your
child. That so.”</p>

    <div>THE VENGEANCE OF USAK</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The towering Alaskan hills overshadowed the broad
waterway of the Hekor River. From the level of the water the
shores rose up monstrously. There were precipitate, sterile,
encompassing walls of granite that rose hundreds of feet without
a break. And back of them, mounting by dizzy slopes, the great
hills raised their snow-crowned crests till the misty cloud line
enveloped them. The world was grey, and dark, and something
overwhelming towards the headwaters of the great river. It was a
territory barren of everything but the tattered clothing of
scattered primordial forest bluffs clinging to sheer slopes, or
safely engulfed in the shelter of deep, shadowed ravines. It was
a scene of crude grandeur in which Nature had designed no place
for man.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet man refused Her denial. Man with his simple skill and
profound daring. No rampart set up by Nature was sufficient to
bar the way.</p>

<p class='c010'>A small kyak was driving against the stream of waters surging
at its prow. It was driven with irresistible skill and power, for
the man at the paddle was consuming with passionate desire and
purpose. For days and days he had driven on up against a stream
that was growing in speed with every passing mile. He knew the
thing confronting him. He knew every inch of the great waterway’s
rugged course. Every shoal, every rapid was an open book to him.
So, too, were the shelters and easements where the stream yielded
its strength. The man behind the paddle faced his task with the
supreme confidence of knowledge and conscious power. And so he
neared the canyon of the Grand Falls without the smallest
perturbation.</p>

<p class='c010'>A mere speck in the immensity of its surrounding the kyak
glided on. Here it rocked on a ruffled surface, there it passed,
perfectly poised, a ghostly shadow upon a smooth mirror-like
surface. The dip of the man’s paddle was precise and rhythmic.
Every ounce of strength was in every stroke, and every stroke
yielded its full of propulsion. For Usak was a master of river
craft, and understood the needs of the journey that still lay
ahead of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>His goal was still far off. It was less than a day since he
had crossed the unmarked border which opened the gates of Alaska
to him. He knew there must be more than another nightless day
pass before he reached the toilsome portage where stood the
mighty Falls which emptied themselves from the summit of the
barrier which he had yet to scale. The goal he sought lay hidden
away up amidst those high lands where the drainings of the
snow-clad hills foregathered before hurling themselves to feed
the river below. But time mattered nothing to his Indian mind. He
asked nothing of the great world about him. He sought no favours
or clemency. The spur of his savage heart drove him, and death
alone could deny him. As he had already driven throughout the
endless Arctic days so he would continue to drive until his task
was accomplished.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s dark face was hard bitten by his mood. Fierce
resolve looked out of eyes that brooded as he gazed alertly over
the waters. The soul of the man was afire with the instincts and
desires of centuries of savage forbears, just as his mental
faculties were similarly keyed for their achievement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Not a detail of the world about him that might affect his
labours escaped the eagle vision of his wide eyes, and his swift
understanding taught him how to avail himself of every clemency
which the scheme of Nature vouchsafed.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the kyak progressed seemingly with inadequate speed, but in
reality little less swiftly than the speed of the avenging
creature’s desire. It gained incredible way against the surge of
water that split upon its prow. And as the shadows of the mighty
walls enveloped it, and grew ever more and more threatening, the
man at the paddle laboured on without pause or hesitation,
certain of the course, certain of his powers, certain that no
earthly barrier was staunch enough to seriously obstruct him.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The kyak was hauled out of the water. It lay there on a
shelving foreshore strewn with grey, broken granite, a graceful
thing, so small and light as to look utterly inadequate in face
of the terrific race of troubled waters that was speeding by. It
was set ready for the portage. The man’s simple outfit was
securely lashed amidships, and his precious rifle, long
old-fashioned, but well cared for, was made fast to the struts
that held the frail craft to its shape.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian was standing at the water’s edge. He was gazing
up-river where its course was a dead straight canyon several
miles in length. It was wide, tremendously wide. But so high were
its sides that its breadth became dwarfed. It was a gloomy,
threatening passage of black, broken water, whose rushing torrent
no canoe could face.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the awe of the scene left Usak untouched. It was not the
sheer cliffs that concerned him. It was not the swirling race of
water blackened by the shadows. It was neither the might of the
great river, nor the vastness of the hill country about it that
pre-occupied him. It was the far-off white wall of mist and spray
at the head of the passage, and the dull distant thunder of the
Falls, the Grand Falls, the picture of whose might had lain
hidden from the eyes of man throughout the centuries.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood for long contemplating the mysterious far-off. His
object was uncertain. Perhaps the wonder of it had power to stir
him. Perhaps he was not insensible to the might of the things
about him for all the absorbing passion that filled him. Perhaps
he was contemplating with a sense of triumph this last barrier
which still remained to be surmounted.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he turned away. He came back to the burden which he
knew he had to shoulder. He measured the little vessel, and the
stowage of his outfit, with a keen eye for the necessity of his
work. And that which had been done left him completely
satisfied.</p>

<p class='c010'>He bent down. He gripped the gunwale of the little craft and
tilted it. Then with a swift, twisting movement he lifted, and,
rearing his great body erect again, the vessel was safely set
where his muscular neck checked it to a perfect balance.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>It was the wide smooth waters of a high perched mountain lake.
Its expanse was dwarfed by the great hills on every hand. Its
surface shone like a mirror in the brilliant sunshine, yet it was
without one single grace to temper the fierce austerity of its
tremendous setting. On the hillsides there were dark veins which
suggested the tattered remnants of Nature’s effort to clothe
their naked sides. There were low fringes of attenuated
vegetation marking the line where land and water met. But the
main aspect was one of barren hills crowned about their lofty
summits with eternal snow, and the grey fields of glacial ice
that never entirely yielded up possession of the earth they held
prisoned.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak’s kyak was hugging the southern shore. Now his paddle
dipped leisurely, for he had no stream with which to battle and
his eyes were searching every yard of the dishevelled scrub which
screened the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly the little craft crept on. There was no uncertainty in
its progress. It was simply that the man sought for the thing he
knew he would find and had no desire to waste a single moment of
precious time through careless oversight.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was rounding a headland. The fringe of scrub had faded out,
leaving only the grey rock that sank sheer into the depths of the
water. In a moment he flung power into the dip of his paddle and
the kyak shot ahead. There was current here. Swift, crossing
current that strove to head his craft put for the bosom of the
lake. The man counted with prompt skill, and a savage
satisfaction shone in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Passing the headland he gazed upon the thing he had been
searching. It was a narrow inlet debouching from a wide rift in
the rampart of hills.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a moment his vessel shot head on to the current. Then,
swiftly, it passed from view of the open lake between the
sheltered banks which were heavily overgrown by unbroken
stretches of dense pine-wood bluffs.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>An amazing transformation left the sterile setting of the
mountain lake forgotten. Farther and farther, deeper and deeper
into the hills the country seemed to change as by magic. East and
west of the valley the hills rose up sheltering the gracious
vegetation that looked to belong to latitudes hundreds of miles
to the south, and a heat prevailed that was even greater than the
intemperate Arctic summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak needed no explanation of the phenomenon. He knew that he
was in the region of the great Fire Hills of the North. Hills
that were always burning, whether in the depths of winter or the
height of summer. And the heat of the earthly fires transformed
the countryside into an oasis of verdant charm, a jewel of Nature
set in the cold iron of the North.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>A large habitation stood in the heart of a wide clearing in
the forest. It was deep hidden from the waterway which split up
the length of the valley. Nearly a mile of narrow roadway cut
through the forest alone gave access to the river. And the course
of the roadway was winding, and its debouchment on the river was
left screened with trees. The object of the latter must have been
clear to the simplest mind. A perfect secrecy had been achieved,
and the great house lay hidden within the forest.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a remarkable building whose only relation to the
country in which it stood was the material of its construction.
Its two lofty stories were built of lateral, rough-hewn green
logs. It was of logs carefully dovetailed, from the ground to the
summit of a central tower which rose to the height of the forest
trees about it. Its walls rambled over a wide extent of ground,
and dotted about its main building were a number of lesser
buildings, both habitations and accommodation for material. It
was rather like a log-built feudal fortress surrounded by, and
protecting, the homes of its workers and dependents.</p>

<p class='c010'>A figure was moving cautiously through the woods beyond the
clearing. The moccasined feet gave out no sound as it passed from
tree to tree or sought the shelter of such dense clumps of
undergrowth as presented themselves. The buckskin-clad creature
crouched low as he moved, and the colour of his garments seemed
to merge itself into the general hue about him. Now and again he
paused for long contemplative moments. And in these he searched
closely with keen, purposeful black eyes that nothing
escaped.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was seeking every sign of life the place might afford. And
so far he had discovered none. There were one or two prowling
dogs, great husky, trail dogs, searching leisurely for that offal
which seems to be the sole purpose of their resting moments, but
that was all.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was gazing upon the main frontage of the building which
faced the south with a long, deep, heavily constructed verandah
running its entire length. The several windows which gave on to
it, covered with mosquito netting, were wide open to admit such
cooling breeze as might chance in the heat of the day. But the
rich curtains hung limply over them undisturbed by the slightest
movement. It was the same with the windows of the upper story.
They, too, were wide open, but again the curtains were unmoving.
The searcher’s eyes passed over the lounging chairs on the
verandah. None were occupied, yet each and all looked to be
standing ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>He passed on. Making a wide detour within the shelter of the
woods he passed round to the western side of the building. Here
there were other habitations. Many were mere log shanties, cabins
such as the searcher knew by heart. The cabin of whiteman or
coloured in a country where makeshift ruled.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again there was no sign of life. There was not even a dog
prowling loose in this direction. Maybe those who peopled these
cabins were resting in the heat. Maybe—but the searching man was
concerned with no such speculation. The thing was largely as he
had expected to find it, but he desired to re-assure himself. He
moved on rapidly. From every point of the compass his searching
eyes surveyed the scene, and finally he came back to the spot
where his prolonged search had started. He was satisfied.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood for a moment while he made his final preparations.
They were simple, savagely simple. He moved the belt about his
waist, and the two long hunting knives thrusting from their
sheaths were brought to the front where they remained ready to
each hand. Then he thrust one hand into a voluminous pocket in
his buckskin and withdrew a heavy pistol. It was a modern pistol,
such as one would hardly expect to find in the dark-skinned hands
of the native bred. This he examined with care and deliberation.
Then he thrust it back whence it came, and moved swiftly out into
the open.</p>

<p class='c010'>The quick eyes of a scavenging dog discovered him and a low
snarl accompanied the canine discovery. Instantly a well-aimed
stone silenced the creature and sent it slinking to cover.</p>

<p class='c010'>The point the man had selected for his approach had been
deliberately chosen. It was a door that stood ajar on the north
side of the house. It obviously admitted to the kitchen place of
the building.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the vanishing of the man through the doorway the
lifelessness of the place which had been momentarily broken
descended upon it again. The still air hummed with the somnolent
drone of myriads of winged insects. The hush of the surrounding
forest seemed to crowd down upon it. The very breathlessness of
the day seemed to suggest the utter impossibility of stirring
life.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a moment, the deathly silence was broken. A sound came
hard in the wake of the passing man. It was a curious,
half-stifled cry, and it came from the direction of the open
doorway. It was low, inarticulate, but it was human. It suggested
much and betrayed nothing. Then as it died out the engulfing
silence descended once more and it remained unbroken.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The wide central hall was unlit by any visible window, yet the
light was perfectly distributed and ample. Furthermore it was the
light of day without one gleam of the dazzling sunshine.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a spacious apartment, lofty and square. Its walls were
covered with rich hangings of simple eastern design. They were
unusually tasteful and delicate, and obviously the handiwork of
home manufacture. The floor of the room was of polished yellow
pine littered with a wealth of natural furs without any
mountings. Every skin was native to the north of Alaska, and the
variety was extensive. In the centre of the room stood a large,
open, log fire set up on a built hearth, above which rose a
chimney passing straight up through the timbered ceiling in the
fashion of an inverted funnel. For all the summer heat the fire
was alight, smouldering pleasantly, a heap of white wood ash
yielding a delightful aroma as the thin spiral of smoke drifted
leisurely up into the mouth of the funnel above it.</p>

<p class='c010'>About the walls stood several low couches. They were loaded
with silken cushions adorned in a fashion similar to the hangings
upon the wall with a lavish display of the representations of
brilliant-hued flowers, and birds, amongst which chrysanthemum,
wistaria, and longbilled, long-legged storks were very
prominent.</p>

<p class='c010'>The only other furnishings in the place were a magnificent
pair of oriental vases standing on carved wood plinths, a large
bookcase that was also a desk with an armchair before it, and two
great, manifold wooden screens with elaborate, incised designs
decorating their panels.</p>

<p class='c010'>In the shelter of one of the latter a small woman was seated
on a couch surrounded by the materials of the delicate embroidery
she was engaged upon. She was seated with her feet tucked under
her, and a book lay in her lap. But she was neither reading nor
sewing now. Her dark eyes were raised alertly. They were gazing
steadily at an angle of the room where a curtain hung in heavy
folds over what was clearly a doorway.</p>

<p class='c010'>The solitary occupant of the room was not young. She was
nearing middle life, yet she bore small enough traces of her
years. She was pretty for all the large tortoise-shell rimmed
glasses she was wearing. Her jet black hair, dressed closely to
her shapely head, bore not a trace of greying, and the small
mouth and softly tinted cheeks were as fresh and delicate as a
young girl’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the moment a keen look of enquiry was revealed through her
large glasses as she regarded the covered doorway. Nor was her
look without a suggestion of unease. For a sound had reached her
a moment before, which, in the silence of the house about her,
had suggested a cry—a cry of pain. Even a call for help.</p>

<p class='c010'>Apparently, however, she dismissed the idea. For she presently
bent over the work she had laid aside in the interest of the book
she had been reading.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was not easily disturbed. She was accustomed to long
periods of almost complete solitude. There were two servants in
the house. She knew that. Men who were fully capable of
safeguarding the place, even though the rest of the folk were
abroad on their labours. No. A long life in the remote fastnesses
of the northern Alaskan hills had taught her many things, and
amongst the things she had learnt was that perfect immunity from
intrusion was vouchsafed to the home which had been provided for
her. There were times, even, when she felt that her lot resembled
that of a closely guarded prisoner.</p>

<p class='c010'>She plied her needle with the skill and rapidity of long
practice. The chrysanthemum she was working was rapidly
developing its full beauty under her delicate hands. Then
suddenly she dropped her hands into her lap and raised her eyes
again to the doorway.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no mistaking her expression now. A voiceless alarm
gazed out through her glasses. There was a sound of hurried
approach. Someone was running beyond the doorway. They were
approaching—</p>

<p class='c010'>The curtain was abruptly dragged aside. A man lurched into the
room. He was a smallish, elderly man, dark-skinned and
eastern-looking. He was clad in the ordinary garments of
civilization, and wore a short apron about his waist. He stood
for a moment clinging to the curtain for support. Agony looked
out of his black eyes, and his lined face was distorted. He
sought to make a gesture with one hand and nearly fell. Then a
sound broke from his lips. It was one word. Only one. And that
barely articulate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Es—cape!” he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a last gasping effort his hand released its hold on the
curtain and he crashed to the floor. And as he fell a stream of
blood trickled on to the immaculate woodwork from somewhere in
the region of his neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman was on her feet. A wild panic shone in the eyes
behind her glasses. She stood there a pretty, pathetic, helpless
little figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Escape!</p>

<p class='c010'>The word was ringing in her ears as she gazed in horror upon
the still, fallen figure of the man who had brought her warning
as the last faithful act of his life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Escape! What did it mean? What could it mean?</p>

<p class='c010'>She abruptly turned away. She bent down and gathered up her
sewing and her book. Then she passed rapidly behind the screen
which sheltered her couch. Only for one instant did she pause
before passing out of view. It was to regard again, with a gaze
that was filled with horror and terror, the poor thing that had
brought her warning.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Usak was standing in the middle of the great room. He was
gazing about him. His dark eyes were aflame with furious desire.
His great body bulked enormously and his rough clothing left him
a sinister figure in a place of such lavish refinement.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took in every detail of the place, and at last his fierce
eyes came to rest on the dead creature lying just within the
doorway. He stared at it without pity or remorse. Without a sign
of added emotion. His thin lips were shut tight and the muscles
of his jaws stood out with the intensity of their grip. That was
all.</p>

<p class='c010'>After awhile he moved away. He passed over to the couch
sheltered by the screen. He bent over it searching closely, and
from among the cushions drew some fragments of sewing silk and
cuttings of material. He gazed at them. But he was not thinking
of them. He was thinking of another woman, a woman whose hands
had been accustomed to ply a needle, and to cut out material. But
the material was different. It was less refined, rougher. In
Usak’s mind Pri-loo’s sewing was mostly to do with the buckskin
and beads so dear to the Indian heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>He flung the things aside. Then he hurried from the room,
passing again the doorway through which he had followed the man
he had slain.</p>

<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div>THE VALLEY OF THE FIRE HILLS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The sun blazed down on a silent world. The glare
was merciless, and the heat, by reason of the weight of moisture
saturating the atmosphere of the valley, was almost a
torture.</p>

<p class='c010'>The stillness of the world was awesome. The hum of insect life
accentuated it, and so, too, with the murmur of summer waters,
which is the real music of the silent places. The breathlessness
of it all suggested suspense, threat. So it is always in the
great hill countries. The sense of threat is ever present to the
human mind, driving men to seek companionship, even if it be only
association with the creatures who are there to bear his
burdens.</p>

<p class='c010'>Threat was stirring acutely now. It was in the profound quiet,
in the saturating heat; it was in the portentous silence wrapt
about the hidden habitation which the man at the water’s edge had
just left behind him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaning on his old-fashioned rifle the Indian, Usak, was
gazing out northwards over the winding course of the river. His
dark eyes were alert, fiercely alert. No detail of the scene
escaped his searching gaze as he followed the little water-course
on its way to the mountain lake beyond. He searched it closely
right up to the great bend where stood the three isolated fire
hills. His Indian mind was calculating; it was seeking answers to
doubts and questions besetting him. For he knew that on the
result of his right thinking now depended the achievement he had
marked out for himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Quite motionless he stood for many minutes. Yet for all his
great height and the physical strength of his muscular body his
presence was without effect upon the immense solitude of the
world about him. It had no more impression than had one single
creature amongst the myriads of flies and mosquitoes swarming
hungrily about his dark head.</p>

<p class='c010'>The house in the woods behind him was no longer of any
concern. There, as he had set out to do, he had already worked
his fierce will. It was sufficient. That which was yet to be
accomplished he knew to lie on the waterway approach, and his
mind was focussed upon the three black, smoking hills which he
had passed on his way from the distant lake.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stirred out of his deep contemplation. He raised his rifle
and slung it upon his buckskin-clad shoulder. Then he turned
about, and raised one lean, brown hand. It was an expressive
gesture. There was something in it similar to the shoulder-shrug
of callous indifference. He passed on down the river.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The canoe was making its leisurely way up the river. The dip
of the paddles was easy; it was rhythmic and full of the music so
perfectly in tune with Nature in her gentler mood. The vessel was
long and low, and built for rapid, heavy transport where the
waters were not always at rest, and the battle with the elements
was fierce and unrelenting. It was the hide-built craft native to
the Eskimo, whose life is spent in the Polar hunt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The vessel was served by eight paddles. But there were two
other occupants lounging amidships against the rolls of blankets
and furs which were part of their camp outfit. These two were
talking in low voices while the men at the paddles, stripped to
the waist, squat, powerful, yellow-skinned creatures whose
muscles rippled in response to their efforts under a skin that
shone like satin, remained concerned only for their labours.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There will be a big noise—later.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The snapping eyes of the younger man were half smiling as he
contemplated the shimmering waters of the river ahead. The man
beside him stirred. His curious eyes lit with a gleam of irony as
he withdrew his gaze from the distant smoke cloud which lolled
ponderously on the still air.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes. There will be a big noise,” he said. “But it doesn’t
matter. Maybe p’lice will come.” He laughed coldly. “An’ when
they come—what? Later they go away. Later it is forgotten. Winter
comes and everything is forgotten. It is the way of this
far-north country. Only is this country for the man who lives in
it. Not for those who mark it on a map, and say—‘it is mine.’ No.
It is for us, Sate. It is ours. We make the law which says the
thing we desire must be ours. Le Gros was a big fool. But it
would have been useless to have his secret and leave him living.
One word, and they would have flooded the country with white
trash from every corner of the earth. It will not be that way
now. We wait for the p’lice to come. We wait for them to go. Then
this thing is ours, the same as all the rest.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sate turned his dark eyes upon the strong profile of his
father.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he agreed, while his eyes questioned.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was usually a question in his eyes when regarding his
parent; a question in his hot impulsive mind when he listened to
the cold tone of authority that was always addressed to him. The
filial attitude of the youth was no more than skin deep.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have the plans safe?” he inquired presently, while he
watched the brown fingers of the other filling the familiar
red-clay pipe. “You have not passed them for me to read?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The tone was a complaint, and it brought the curious regard of
the tawny eyes to the discontented face. For a moment Sate
confronted them boldly. Then he yielded, and his gaze was turned
upon the scenes of the river. “You will see them when—it is
necessary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A dark fire was burning behind the boy’s pre-occupied gaze.
Nor was it likely that the father failed to understand the mood
his denial had aroused. He watched the lowering of the black
brows, the savage setting of the youthful jaws, and a shadowy
smile that had nothing pleasant in it made its way to his cold
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>For all his surge of feeling Sate continued to regard the
surrounding mountains through which they were passing. There was
not a detail of the course of this little, hidden river that held
even a passing interest for the youth. His whole life had been
lived within the Valley of the Fire Hills and its beauty, the
mystery of it affected him no more congenially than might a
prisoner be affected by the bare walls and iron bars of his cell.
His heart and mind were in fierce rebellion. He was chafing
impotently. But he was held silent, for he dared not pit himself
against the iron will, the inhuman cruelty which he knew to lie
behind the cold eyes which, in his brief twenty years of life, he
had only learned to obey through fear.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man beside him had lit his pipe without a shadow of
concern, and now he sat smoking it like any native, with its stem
supported by his strong jaws thrust in the centre of his hard
mouth. He held the little bowl in both hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The vessel passed out of the shadow of the canyon, and the
welcome shade gave place to the blazing heat of full sunlight.
The sky was without a cloud except for the overhanging smoke
patch. The great hills had suddenly leapt back and the world had
become radiant with a hundred verdant hues, and the soft purple
of the distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the arena of the Fire Hills. They stood up in the heart
of it, three of them. Three comparatively low, expansive hummocks
dwarfed by the tremendous altitude of the surrounding mountain
ring. Standing widely separated on the low flat, about which the
shrunken summer river skirted, they stood ominous, black and
smoking. They were bare to the basaltic rock which was their
whole structure, burnt black by the centuries of fire contained
within their troubled hearts. They were stark, hideous, like
malevolent dwarfs, monstrous and threatening, frowning down upon
a world made gracious the year round by reason of their own
involuntary beneficence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man removed his pipe from between his lips and inclined
his head in the direction of the smoking hills.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An hour more,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sate’s reply came without glancing round.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>His eyes, too, were on the three hills. It would have been
impossible for it to have been otherwise. Their great ugly
shoulders rose high above the belt of forest trees which lined
the left bank of the river, and the smoke cloud hung heavily over
the summits, till their appearance was like that of giant
mushrooms. The smoke was motionless, dense, threatening.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s thick,” the father observed reflectively. “We need a
wind to carry it away. If the weather changes it’ll come down in
a fog. They’re queer—those hills. Someday they’ll—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sharp crack of a rifle rang out. The man in the prow of
the vessel jerked forward in the act of dipping his paddle, and
sprawled with his body lolling over the vessel’s side.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man with the yellow eyes scrambled to his feet and Sate
sat up. For one tense moment every eye was turned upon the belt
of trees that lined the shore masking the base of the Fire Hills.
The shot had come from that direction, but there was nothing, no
sign of any sort to give a clue to the whereabouts of the man who
had fired with such murderous accuracy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man standing amidships gave a sharp order. His crew had
quit paddling in the complete confusion into which the attack had
flung them. And, in a moment, the paddles dipped again, but only
seven of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sate passed forward to the wounded man, and his father waited,
still standing, for the result of his investigations. It was some
time before the youth gave a sign. But at last he dragged the
fallen body into the boat and laid it out in the bottom of
it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The demand came sharply. But the tawny eyes were still
steadily searching the wood-clad bank of the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Sate’s reply was no less sharp.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drop him overboard. We’ve no room for dead men. Take the
paddle yourself, Sate.” After delivering his order the man
amidships turned about and spoke in a foreign tongue to the man
in the stern. Instantly the prow of the vessel swung towards the
shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again a shot rang out. This time it was the man whose paddle
had changed the vessel’s course who was the victim. He lolled
forward like a tired man at the finish of the stroke of his
paddle. Then he crumpled, collapsing against the man in front of
him, shot through the heart.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The dusky figure was moving rapidly down the shadowed aisles
of leafless tree-trunks. Its movements were almost without sound.
They were the stealthy, swift movements of the Indian in pursuit
of a wary quarry.</p>

<p class='c010'>Every now and again Usak paused in the shelter of a great
forest bole, and his fierce eyes searched for opening in the
barrier of undergrowth that hid the waters of the river beyond.
His patience seemed inexhaustible. Effort was unrelaxing. He was
spurred by a lust that was all-consuming.</p>

<p class='c010'>So he kept pace with the moving vessel that was behind him on
the river. His object was to keep ever ahead of it, not remaining
a second longer at any given point than his purpose demanded. On,
and on, with the swift, silent gait of the hunter, he passed from
tree to tree but never did he permit himself to pass out of
gunshot of his quarry.</p>

<p class='c010'>He paused at a fallen tree. To the right of him, looking down
the river, was a narrow break in the tangle of undergrowth. He
rested his queer, long rifle and searched over the sights,
holding a definite spot on the shining waters covered. The man
was deadly in his deliberation. Twice he re-adjusted his sights.
Then at last, apparently satisfied, stretched prone on the ground
under cover of the protecting tree trunk, he waited with the
weapon pressed hard into his shoulder, his lean tenacious finger
on the trigger, and an eye, that displayed no shadow of mercy,
glancing over his sights.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moments passed in deathly silence. The trees above him
creaked in the super-heated twilight. But none of the forest
sounds distracted him. His keen ears were listening for one
familiar sound. His searching eyes were waiting for one vision in
the narrow opening of the undergrowth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound came. And into the open flashed the prow of the
approaching canoe. It was more than two hundred yards from the
man’s place of concealment, but the distance had been calculated
to a fraction with the skill of a great hunter. The finger
pressed the trigger.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hidden man leaped to his feet, a grim look of satisfaction
shining in his eyes. He had witnessed the thing he desired. He
had seen the man at the vessel’s prow fall forward. And he knew
it was the man who had taken the place of an earlier victim.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was off on the run as an answering shot rang out, and he
heard the spat of a bullet strike one of the tree trunks
somewhere behind him. There was another shot, and another. But
each shot found its home in the upstanding tree-trunks far in the
rear of him, and left him grimly unconcerned. It was a battle to
the death in a fashion of which he was absolutely master. It
mattered not to him if the canoe continued on its course, or
retreated, or if the enemy abandoned the river and sought to
continue the fight in the twilight of the forests. He knew he
held him at his mercy on this great bend of the river. For the
far bank was walled by the granite of the great hills which
closed in the arena of the Fire Hills. There was no escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>After awhile he paused again at the foot of a tree that had
been rudely storm-blasted. Its crown was shorn and lay a vast
tangle on the ground beside it. In a moment, with rifle slung, he
had swarmed the broken trunk and lodged himself in the lower
branches which still remained. He gazed out over the top of the
undergrowth, and a great length of the sweep of the river was
spread out before his hungry eyes. The canoe was just entering
his field of vision. He settled himself with his back to the
tree-trunk, and his knees were bent in a squatting posture with
his feet supported on a projecting limb which also helped to
screen him from those on the river. He adjusted his sights and
prepared to hurl death from his hiding-place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly he pressed the trigger and his ancient weapon
faithfully responded. The ivory sights were unfailing to an eye
behind which burned so fierce a desire. He saw the result even
with the rifle still pressed to his shoulder, and unconsciously
he pronounced the triumphant thought in his mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Four!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He re-loaded. The canoe was in full view now, and the
temptation was irresistible. Again he pressed the trigger, and
another life had passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>He lowered his weapon and watched. The short man amidships was
about to answer. He saw a rifle raised. The shot echoed against
the granite walls behind it. And something like a smile lit the
hunter’s eyes, for the man had fired into the forest far below
where he was securely seated. Instantly he re-loaded, and, a
moment later, a sixth victim fell to his lethal weapon.</p>

<p class='c010'>He dropped from his “crow’s nest” and ran on through the dark
aisles that hid him so well. Every foot of the way was mapped in
his mind. He had laid his trail with the skill of a man who,
knowing his craft, will not yield one fraction of his advantage.
So he passed on to where the forest narrowed down by reason of
the Fire Hill, whose ponderous slopes came down almost to the
river bank.</p>

<p class='c010'>He passed from the forest and began the ascent of the hill.
Here there was no cover but the rough, protruding boulders on the
blackened slopes. But he had reached a point of calculated
recklessness when he knew he must court greater chances for the
success he desired. There had been ten men in the canoe when
first he had welcomed the sight of it upon the river. Ten men,
all of whom had participated in the wanton destruction of
everything in the world that had meant life, and hope, and home
to him. Now there were only four.</p>

<p class='c010'>The canoe was within a mile of its destination, and he had
decided before that destination was reached only one single man
of its complement must remain alive. His purpose was implacable.
Vengeance consumed the man. And it was the vengeance that only
the savage heart of a creature of his ancestry could have
contemplated.</p>

<p class='c010'>He passed on up the slope with the speed of some swiftfooted
forest creature. And the smoke haze rising from the summit
partially obscured the drab of his clothing against the blackened
ground. Up towards the belching crown he moved, but ever with a
glance flung backward lest the increasing density of the smoke
cloud should mar his view of the things below.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he came to a halt. The point had been reached when he
dared proceed no farther. The haze, in the brilliant air, was
sufficient to screen him without obscuring his vision of the
river. So he took up a position behind a boulder, and leant upon
it with his rifle supported for steadiness on its clean-cut
surface. For some moments he watched the fierce efforts of the
remainder of the crew of the canoe to make the shelter of the
house something less than a mile away to his left.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, there were four of them only. And all four were paddling
literally for their lives. He watched them closely, a devilish
smile lighting his satisfied eyes. And he saw that the rhythm of
their stroke had been lost, and the speed of the vessel was
infinitely slow. Oh, yes, he understood. Panic had done its work.
The panic inspired by complete impotence. They were there a
target for just so long as they were in the open of the river.
There was no shelter for them anywhere. The granite of the far
wall of the river cut off escape, and the forest on the hither
side contained the deadly, unseen danger. So there was nothing
left them but to race on, zigzagging a course down the river in
the hope of escape from the deadly fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>He re-adjusted the sights of his rifle and judged his
distance. Slowly and very deliberately he pressed the trigger.
The shot passed over the canoe. He re-loaded without concern, and
his second shot left only three paddles dipping. The man in the
bow of the boat squatted drooping and clutching for support.</p>

<p class='c010'>He waited for the final result of his shot, and it came as the
man yielded his hold and dropped helplessly into the bottom of
the boat. Again he laid his weapon. Two more shots rang out from
the smoke shroud of the burning hill. Then, after a brief
interval, two more carried their deadly burden. The man re-loaded
again and again till a pile of empty shells lay close beside him.
Then, at last, he rose from his crouching position and stretched
his cramping limbs. He slung his hot rifle upon his shoulder, and
stood gazing down upon the slowly moving boat as it laboured over
the water. He was completely satisfied. Now there was left but
one man to drive the heavy vessel to the haven which should mean
shelter from his murderous sniping.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The man with the yellow eyes drove hard with his paddle and
the nose of the vessel thrust deep into the mud of the landing.
For a moment he remained kneeling, supported against the strut
where he had laboured. He made no attempt to leave his post. Only
he gazed along down the river bank at the screen of bush which
lined it. There was no emotion visible in his mask-like face.
There was nothing in his eyes to tell of the swift, urgent
thought behind them.</p>

<p class='c010'>After awhile his gaze was withdrawn to the grim freight of his
vessel. Then he stood up quickly and moved forward. Four bodies
were lying huddled in the bottom of the canoe. With three of them
he was completely unconcerned. But with the fourth it was
different. He stood for a moment gazing down unemotionally at the
dead body of the youthful Sate. Then he stooped, and, gathering
it in his powerful arms, carried it quickly ashore. He laid it
gently down on a vivid bed of Arctic wild flowers and stood over
it in silent contemplation.</p>

<p class='c010'>His pre-occupation was intense. But he gave no sign. Such
emotions as were his were his alone. They were stirring in a
heart deep hidden. And his tawny eyes masked no less surely now
than was always their habit.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sound disturbed him at last, and he turned like a panther
ready for anything it might portend. But the flash of alertness
died out of his eyes at the sight of a woman’s small figure as it
broke its way through the bush in the direction of the house
which was his home.</p>

<p class='c010'>The pretty face the man was looking into was drawn and
haggard. The slanting eyes were full of a terror that even the
long awaited return of her man could not banish. The woman had
run to him with little, hurried strides and hands outstretched in
piteous appeal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hela!” she cried. And into the pronunciation of the man’s
name, and in the pitch of her voice she contrived to fling a
world of woman’s terrified despair.</p>

<p class='c010'>For once the man’s eyes revealed something of that which was
passing behind them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me, Crysa,” he demanded urgently. “Tell me quick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The distraught woman stood clinging to the arm which made no
effort to yield her support. She broke at once into hysterical
speech in a foreign tongue.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They have killed them all. Even the dogs. There is not one
left. All—all are killed. Myso, Oto, Lalman. Oh, they murder them
with the knife. I hid in the secret place. It was Oto who gave me
warning with his dying words. He was dead—all dead in a moment. I
can see the blood on the floor now. Devils came to the house. An
army of them. They—Oh!” she cried breaking off the torrent of her
disjointed story in a spasm of new horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her gaze had fallen on the still, prone figure at her man’s
feet. Her hands dropped from his arm. She moved a step from him,
and bending forward, peered down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dead, too,” she said, in a low hushed voice. “Dead!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she recognized the dark features of the boy who was her
son. Suddenly a piercing cry broke the silence of the woods about
them, and echoed against the far walls that shut in the
river.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sate!” she cried. “Our Sate!” And in a moment she had flung
her frail body upon the still figure stretched upon its bed of
wild flowers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man looked on. He watched the delicate hands as they beat
the ground in his wife’s paroxysm of grief. He listened to her
demented shrieks of lamentation. But he gave no sign; he offered
no comfort. Maybe he found himself simply helpless. Maybe in his
hard, unyielding mood he felt it best that the woman’s storm of
grief should spend itself. Perhaps, even, the disaster of his
journey home had left him indifferent to everything else.
Certainly his cruel eyes were without any softening, without any
expression but that which was usual to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman’s lamentations died down to heart-racked sobs, and
the man turned away. He passed slowly down to the boat, so deeply
nosed into the mud, and the lessening cries of the distracted
mother pursued him. But he no longer gave heed to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>He laid hold of the canoe and set to hauling it clear of the
water. Once, twice, thrice he heaved with all the strength of his
powerful body. The boat was half way up the bank. Then, as he lay
to the work again, a cry that was something like a snarl broke
from him. Some great body had leapt on him from behind. His hold
was torn loose from his task, and he was flung bodily, with
terrific force, sprawling amidst the radiant flowers that
littered the river bank. The dark, avenging figure of the Indian,
Usak, stood over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>For one brief instant eye searched eye. No word passed the
lips of either. It was a moment of furious challenge, a moment of
murderous purpose. It passed. And its passing came with the
lunging of the Indian as he precipitated himself upon his
victim.</p>

<p class='c010'>They lay writhing, and twisting, and struggling on the ground.
No vocal sound, no sound but the sound of furious movement came
in the struggle. The Indian was uppermost, as he had intended to
be from the moment and the method of his attack. He had one
object, and one object only.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian’s great size and strength were overwhelming with
the other caught at a disadvantage. Then the man with the yellow
eyes was fully two decades older. Usak was lithe, active as a
wild cat, with all the bulk of a greater forest beast. Then there
was his simple, terrible purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was done, finished in a few awful moments. A sound broke
from the man underneath the Indian’s body. It was a half-stifled
choking cry. It was inarticulate except that it was a cry of pain
and suffering for which there could be no other expression. And
instantly all struggling ceased.</p>

<p class='c010'>The arms of the man underneath fell away. Usak leapt to his
feet and his savage eyes glowered down on the writhing body on
the ground. For a moment he watched the tortured creature,
effortless except for the physical contortions of unspeakable
suffering. And presently he heard the thing he had awaited. It
was a faint, low moaning forced at last from between the blinded
man’s stubbornly pressed lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>Fierce, harsh words leapt in answer to the sound, and the
Indian spoke out of the original savagery that was his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So! Euralian Chief!” he cried exultantly. “You not know all
this you mak, or you not mak it so. No. I tell you this—I, Usak.
You come kill my woman, Pri-loo. You kill my good boss, Marty Le
Gros. You come to steal. But you not steal. Only you kill my
woman, Pri-loo, an’ my good boss. So I, Usak, come. I kill up all
the mans, everything. But not so I kill your woman. Not so I kill
you. Oh, no. That for bimeby. Now I tak out your eyes. If I kill
up your woman you die. No good. No. So I leave you your woman.
She lie there by your son. She look this way now to see the thing
I do. Bimeby she come. She forget the son I shoot all up. She
remember only her man who will live in darkness. It good. It just
how I think. Bimeby she come. She mak you live. She, your woman.
She lead you by the hand. She feed you. She mak you see through
her eyes. So you know the hell you show to me. Oh, yes. It black
hell for you. No light no more. Your folk come. They find you.
You not see them. Nothing. Then they go leave you. An’ so you
live—in hell. Bimeby I come. Big long time I come. An’ when I
come I kill you. I kill you an’ your woman all up dead, same as
you kill my woman, Pri-loo. Now I go. I go an’ think, think, how
I mak kill you—sometime.”</p>

    <div>PLACER CITY</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bill Wilder smiled in an abstracted, wry sort of
fashion as he strode down the boarded sidewalk, which was no more
than sufficient for its original purpose of saving pedestrians
from wallowing in the mire and stagnant water of the unmade main
throughfare of Placer City.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was on his way to his office from his house. His house was
built well beyond the tattered city’s limits with a view to
escape from the sordid atmosphere of the northern gold city,
which in the long years of acquaintance he had learned to
detest.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder was the wealthiest gold man in a city of extreme
wealth. Ten years of abounding success had transformed a youth of
barely eighteen, lean, large, angular, yearning with every
wholesome human desire, into a man of twenty-eight, glutted and
overburdened with a fortune and mining interests the extent of
which even he found it well nigh impossible to estimate. In ten
years, under the driving force of inflexible resolve, backed by
amazing good fortune, he had achieved at an age when the
generality of men are only approaching the threshold of affairs
that really matter.</p>

<p class='c010'>But somehow his success had brought him little enough joy. It
had brought him labour that was incessant. It had made it
possible that every whim of his could be satisfied by the stroke
of the pen. But instead of satisfaction, he reminded himself that
somehow his life had become completely and utterly empty, and he
yearned to set the clock back to those long, arduous, struggling
days, when hope and resolve had been able to drive him to greater
and greater exertions, with a pocket-book that was almost as lean
and hungry as his stomach.</p>

<p class='c010'>His smile now was inspired by the memory of a brief interview
he had just had on his way down, in the hall of the McKinley
Hotel, with a Hebrew acquaintance, a wealthy and influential
saloon-proprietor. A. Feldman had spent half-an-hour in
endeavouring to get him to join forces in the erection of a new
dance hall that was intended to eclipse anything of the kind in
the country in size, splendour, and profits. His reply had been
curt. It had been harsh in its bitter condemnation. And the
memory of the Jew’s hopeless stare of amazement was with him
now.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not on your life, Feldman,” he had said in conclusion. “I’m a
gold man. No better and no worse. I’m not a brothel keeper.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His smile passed, and he gazed about him at the moving traffic
surging along the miserable highway under the dazzling sunlight
of a perfect spring day. He had no particular claim to good
looks. His face was strong, and his expression open. There was a
certain angularity about his clean-shaven features, and a simple
directness in his clear-gazing grey eyes. He looked a typical
gold man without pretence or display, and from the careless
roughness of his tweed clothing no one would have taken him for a
man who counted his wealth in millions of dollars.</p>

<p class='c010'>But that was the man. Achievement was the sole purpose of his
life. And it must be the achievement of a great body and muscles
rather than the subtle scheming of the acute commercial mind
which he by no means lacked.</p>

<p class='c010'>The life of this mushroom northern city only stirred him to
repugnance. He was no prude. He had tasted of the life in the
fevered moments of youth. But he knew, he had strong reason to
know, there was nothing in it that money could not buy, from the
governing corporation to the women and gunmen who haunted the
dance halls, except the Mounted Police detachment. And somehow
the knowledge had become completely hateful to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had migrated to the place during one of its early “rushes,”
when it was only a few degrees removed from a mining camp. A
whirlwind rush of humanity had swept down upon it bearing him on
its tide. And he had remained to witness its leaping development
into an established city of wealth and wanton freedom. Later he
had participated in an attempt at real government by the saner
element of its people, and the making safe of life and property.
With them he had hoped. He had looked on at the mushroom growth
of great hotels and offices, and greater and more elaborate halls
of public entertainment. Then, with those others, he had watched
the wreckage of the new authority under pressure of vested
interests, and witnessed the passing of the moment or moral
uplift. The falling back into a mire of corruption had been
literally headlong.</p>

<p class='c010'>The city had grown up in the wide valley of the Hekor River at
the point where the first alluvial strike had been made. It was
at a point where the river widened out before dispersing its
northern waters into a great lake surrounded by the lofty range
of hills which had created it. It followed the usual lines of all
these improvised northern places of habitation. It was designed
in a rectangular fashion based on one interminable main
thoroughfare, which was the centre of haphazard development. The
road had sidewalks, but for the rest it remained unconstructed.
Vehicular traffic wallowed in mire during the spring, jolted and
bumped over a broken, dusty surface in summer, and, in winter,
enjoyed a foundation of snow on which to travel that frequently
stood five and six feet in depth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole place was hopelessly straggling and unkempt. Lofty
seven- and eight-storied buildings looked down on the log
shanties and frame hutments grovelling at their feet in that
incongruous fashion which never seems to disturb the human sense
of fitness. There were even men amongst its cosmopolitan people
who found joy in the disparity. But these were mainly the folk
who owned or had designed the greater structures.</p>

<p class='c010'>Throughout the long winter night the place was ablaze with
electric light, a never-ending source of joy to the crude
pioneering mind. Arc lamps lit the main thoroughfare, while a
multitude of winking signs served to guide the unwary to those
accommodating dens waiting to unloose inflated bank rolls. During
the six months of summer daylight this service was unnecessary.
And only the cold light standards, and the hideous framing of the
signs, and the tawdry decorations of the places of entertainment
were left to replace the winter splendour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder knew it all by heart, from the elaborate Elysee,
down to the meanest cabaret from which a drunken miner would be
fortunate to escape with nothing worse than a vanished store of
“dust.” He hated it. The knowledge of the life that went on every
hour of the twenty-four sickened and bored him. He longed for the
free, wholesome, hard-living life of the outworld beyond the
sordid prison bars which his fortune had set up about him.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was always the same now. Month in, month out, there was
nothing but the solitude of his home and the work of the office
in the great commercial block he had built, or the pastimes of
the dance hall and gambling hell.</p>

<p class='c010'>He wanted none of it. His great body was rusting with disuse,
while the mental effort of the administration of his affairs was
fast robbing his sober senses of all joy of life. He yearned for
the open with all its privations. He wanted the canoe nosing into
the secret places of the far world. The burden of the battle
against Nature in her fiercest mood was something to be desired.
And so, too, with the howl of the deadly blizzard beyond the flap
door of a flimsy tent. At this moment Placer City and all its
alleged attractions were anathema to the man on the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c010'>He came to an abrupt halt. His grey eyes were turned on the
elaborate entrance doors of the Elysee on the opposite side of
the road. It was disgorging its freight into the smiling spring
sunlight, a throng of men and painted women who had spent the
daylit night drinking, and dancing, and gambling. He watched them
out of sheer disgust. Here at something like ten in the morning,
when the sidewalks were thronged with business traffic, they were
just about to seek their homes for that brief sufficiency of rest
which would enable them to return to another night of loose
pleasure. For all he was on the youthful side of thirty, for all
he was inured to the life of the city, for all his blood was no
less warm, and rich, and swift flowing, the sight mingled pity
with disgust and left him depressed and even saddened. The
terrible falseness of it; the price that must be ultimately paid.
The bill of interest that would be presented by an outraged
Nature later on would mean overwhelming bankruptcy for the
majority. He turned away and collided with an officer of the
police.</p>

<p class='c010'>Superintendent Raymes stepped clear and laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Bill Wilder gawking at the Elysee’s throw-outs? Guess you
aren’t yearning to join that bunch?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill replied without any responsive laugh. Superintendent
Raymes was his oldest friend in Placer City. A brisk, dapper man
of medium height he was almost dwarfed by Wilder’s great size. He
was approaching middle life, and already a slight greying tinged
the dark hair below his smart forage cap. He was wearing a
black-braided patrol jacket, and the yellow-striped breeches and
top-boots so familiar in the regions under the control of the
Mounted Police.</p>

<p class='c010'>Raymes shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. That’s only for the sharks and darn fools that life seems
to set around like the sands on the sea shore. Can you beat it?
Look at ’em piling into the rigs. They’re sick and mighty weary,
and they’ll be at it again in a few hours. It beats me the way
those poor women keep going. As for the boys—God help ’em when
those vultures have wrung them dry. Where are you making?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just the office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again Raymes laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sounds like the cemetery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A smile returned to the eyes of the gold man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s how it seems to me,” he said, as they walked on
together. “The cemetery of all that’s worth while. It’s tough,
Raymes. I’m sick to death counting dollars and looking at that
sort of stuff.” He jerked his head in the direction of the
Elysee. “I tell you I’m going to make a break. I’ve just got to.
It’s that or go crazy. I guess I love this Northland to death for
all the flies, and skitters, and the other things, but I can’t
face its cities any longer without qualifying for the
bughouse.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The policeman remained silent in face of the man’s desperate,
half-laughing earnestness. He knew Wilder’s moods. He understood
that tremendous fighting spirit which was consuming all his peace
of mind. They passed on down the sidewalk.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was not a little curious how these two men had come
together in intimate friendship. It had begun when Raymes was
only an Inspector and Wilder was only beginning to realise the
burden of a wealth that grew like a snowball. They had found
themselves in deadly opposition as a result of a desperate
outbreak of lawlessness on a big new “strike” for which the gold
man had been responsible. The position had been gravely
threatening. There had been murder, and claim jumping, and the
whole camp was on edge and threatening something like civil
warfare. In the absence of police there was no authority to
control the camp. Realising the seriousness of the position
Wilder had jumped in. Organizing his men, and collecting others
who could be relied on, he armed them for the task, and forthwith
launched his forces against the marauding gunmen who had
established a reign of terror. There was no mercy and only
summary justice. Every offender was dealt with on the spot, and,
in the end, the camp was swept clean.</p>

<p class='c010'>When it was all over the gold man found the consequences of
his action were far more serious than his logic had suggested. He
had to face the tribunal of Placer City and render a complete
accounting, with Inspector Raymes, keenly jealous of the law of
which he was guardian, in deadly opposition. It had been a bitter
fight. But Wilder’s downright honesty, his frank sincerity had
finally broken down the police officer’s case and left him victor
in a battle that had been fought out mainly on technicalities.
And in the end, in place of the bitter antagonism which might
well have arisen between them, a bond of great friendship was
founded, based on a deep, mutual admiration for the purpose by
which both were inspired.</p>

<p class='c010'>All this had taken place about five years earlier. And since
that time their regard for each other had ripened to an intimacy
that had never known set-back.</p>

<p class='c010'>Raymes was deeply concerned for his friend’s outburst.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Bill,” he said presently. “It’s tough on a boy like you.
You collected your dust too quick. You haven’t the temper of a
millionaire. You aren’t the man to sit around spinning every darn
dollar into two, and grousing because you can’t make three of
it.” He laughed. “You’re the kind of hoss built for the race
track of life. You weren’t made to stand around in the barn
waiting to haul a swell buggy by way of exercise. That break away
is the thing for you, only I’ll hate to lose you out of this darn
sink.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded and smiled, and the whole of his boyish face
lighted up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s the best I’ve listened to in months,” he said. “I
guessed you’d say I was all sorts of a darn fool not fancying
stopping round and counting my dollars. But this ‘sink’ as you
rightly call it. I’m a bit of a kid to you. Maybe I’m a
long-headed kid in a way. But a sink don’t count much on that. If
you live in a sink at my age there’s a mighty big chance you’ll
sooner or later join up with the sort of muck you mostly find in
a sink. And the thought scares me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The policeman glanced round with twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can always sit around on top. You can breathe good air
that way and enjoy the sunlight.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The other shrugged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ risk falling in when it gets you—well asleep. No, George.
You were right first time. I’ll make the break an’ get out of the
way of any chance of—mishap.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They had reached the square frame building of the police post
and paused at the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There mustn’t be any mishap,” Raymes said smiling up into the
earnest face of the man for whom he felt some sort of
responsibility. “Are you yearning for that office of yours? Or do
you feel like wasting an hour while I talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill looked keenly down into the other’s twinkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’s the game?” he asked with a directness that was almost
brusque. Then he laughed. “But there, I guess I’m mostly ready to
listen when George Raymes fancies talking. It isn’t every oyster
that’s full of pearls. Sure. I’ll be glad of the excuse to dodge
the office.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The superintendent shook his head and his smile passed,
leaving his face set and purposeful.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Typhoid’s a deal more prevalent in oysters than pearls,” he
said grimly. “Come right in.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>It was a bare, comfortless office, clean scrubbed and dusted
but quite without anything in its furnishing to indicate the
superior rank of the man who used it. It was characteristic,
however, of the men whose ceaseless activities alone contrive
that the northern outlands shall escape the worst riot of human
temper. The boarded walls were hung with files. A small iron safe
stood in one corner of the room, and a large woodstove occupied
another. There was a roll-top desk near by the one window that
lit the room, and a plain wooden cupboard stood against the wall
directly behind the chair which Superintendent Raymes occupied.
There were two or three Windsor chairs about the walls, and the
only luxury the room afforded was a large rocker-chair into which
Bill Wilder had sprawled his great body.</p>

<p class='c010'>On the desk in front of the officer was a musty-looking file
of papers. It was unopened at the moment for the man was
contemplating one of several letters that lay beside it. He was
leaning back in his revolving chair, and a curious, thoughtful
look was in his reflective eyes. Bill Wilder was removing the
paper band from the cigar the other had forced upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Raymes looked up after awhile and sat regarding the man with
the cigar.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you’re going to sell out, Bill,” he said quietly. “You’re
going to sell out everything, all your interests, and—quit?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And make some sort of use of a life that’s creaking with rust
in every blamed joint.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill thrust the cigar into his mouth and prepared to light
it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The other shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We mustn’t lose you, Bill. You’re the only feller in this
muck hole we can’t do without. I’m not thinking of Placer City
only. I’m thinking of this great old north country to which—you
belong.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The policeman watched the cloud of smoke which the gold man’s
powerful lungs exhaled. He saw the match extinguish, and followed
its flight as it was flung into the cuspidor which stood beside
the stove. He was thinking hard and wondering. He was not quite
sure how best to deal with the thing he had in his mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s like you, George,” he said. “If I listened to you, and
took you seriously, I’d guess I’m some feller—with dollars or
without. But you’re right when you say I belong to this old north
country. I’d hate quitting it. I’d hate it bad. If I could locate
a real use for myself in it I’d sooner serve it than any other.
And the tougher the service the better it would make me feel.
Gee! I’m soft and flabby like some darn fish that’s been stewing
in the sun.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know.” The policeman forced a laugh. He had made up his
mind. “Here, I’ve a mighty interesting letter come along. It’s
from the Fur Valley Corporation. Do you know ’em? They’ve a big
range of trading posts up an’ down the country. They’ve got one
on the Hekor, away up north on the edge of the Arctic. It’s
mainly been a seal trading post, and they collect sable and fox
up that way. This letter says they’re closing it down. There’s a
reason. And they fancied handing it on to me. Do you feel like
taking a read of it? It’s quite short. These folk are business
people without a big imagination so they keep to plain
facts.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill reached out and took the proffered letter. It was dated
Seattle, and was clearly from the head office of the company. He
glanced at the signature to it and noted the paper heading. Then
he read slowly and carefully, for he knew that George Raymes had
serious reason for handing it to him.</p>

<p class='c014'>Dear Sir,</p>

<p class='c015'>In the ordinary course of business we should not think of
troubling you, a distinguished officer of the incomparable
force to which you belong, with the contents of this letter.
Although it is merely to notify our intention of closing down
our trading post, Fort Cupar, at Fox Bluff, on the Hekor River,
which is within one hundred miles of the Alaskan boundary,
there are reasons lying behind the simple fact such as we feel
you, in your official capacity, will be interested to hear.</p>

<p class='c015'>Put as briefly as possible these are the reasons.</p>

<p class='c015'>Fort Cupar at Fox Bluff has been one of our fur-trading
posts, yielding us a very fair harvest of Beaver, Fox, Sable,
Seal. Up to some eighteen years ago we had reason to consider
it our most profitable post. Then came a slump. This came
suddenly. And, according to our factor’s interpretation, it was
simply, and solely due to the appearance of a large band of
foreign poachers, who, without scruple for humanity, or
international honesty, terrorized the Eskimo into passing them
their trade at starvation values, or, if they refused, robbed
them with the utmost violence.</p>

<p class='c015'>These reports at the time were duly passed on to the
headquarters of the police, and were, I believe, carefully
looked into. But for reasons of which we have no cognizance,
possibly the far inaccessibility of the country, possibly
because these poachers were located on the United States side
of the Alaskan border, possibly under pressure of work in the
various gold regions, which is the primary duty of your
officers, these poachers were permitted to continue their
depredations, which, as far as we can ascertain, involved
amongst other crimes that of almost wholesale murder.</p>

<p class='c015'>Our concern now is to tell you that for the last fifteen to
eighteen years we have struggled to carry on our post in this
region in the hope that things would ultimately straighten
themselves out, and our trade return to its normal prosperity.
But this has not been the case. Apparently, from our factor’s
reports, the methods of these poachers, who seem to be a race
of Alaskan Eskimo, who are known as the Euralians, have changed
only in process but not in effect. Now they seem to be divided
up into lone bands of marauders, frequently at war with each
other. There seems to be no controlling chief as there was in
years gone by. They operate within the Arctic Circle, and only
amongst the Eskimo of that region. And the one time descents
upon the more southern communities of whites and natives no
longer take place. Meanwhile, however, all trade in the furs we
desire is at an end. Therefore we are reluctantly forced to
close down, and thus another serious blow to the Canadian fur
trade is involved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill looked up from his reading and encountered the searching
gaze of his friend.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s a nasty bite in that ‘brief’,” the policeman
smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>The gold man nodded seriously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not more than I’d have put in it if I’d been general manager
of that corporation.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. And you’d have been right. That letter’s mighty
reasonable, and I’m with the feller who wrote it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Superintendent Raymes turned to his desk and opened the
rusty-looking file that was lying in front of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, Bill, that letter got me right away. But I was a
bit helpless. Here, now, you sit right there and smoke that cheap
cigar I pushed at you while I do a talk. I’ve got a yarn to hand
you that’ll maybe set you thinking hard.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He sat back tilting his chair, and the rusty file lay open on
his lap. The papers it held had lost their pristine whiteness.
There were distinct signs of age in their hues.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know I’ve only had charge of Placer City for something
like seven years, and things have been so darned busy since I
first got around I haven’t had a great chance of looking into the
remoter things my predecessor left behind him. Eighteen years of
police life is liable to accumulate a bunch of stories it would
take a lifetime reading.</p>

<p class='c010'>“However,” he went, glancing down at the file, “when I
received that letter I got tremendously busy hunting up old
records, and, after nearly a day’s work I came to the conclusion
that I’d opened up one of the worst stories, and one of the most
important, that I’d found in years. I found story after story of
these Euralians. They mostly came from Fort Cupar at Fox Bluff,
but they also came from simple, uneducated trappers, and from
whitemen who adventured northward of here after gold. They came
from all sorts of folk, and one and all corroborated all that
that letter contains besides presenting many lurid pictures of
the doings of these toughs which that letter only hints at.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He removed several sheets of discoloured foolscap from the
file. They were pinned together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ve selected this report which is dated fifteen years ago.
It comes from a man named Jim McLeod, and he was factor for the
Fur Valley Corporation at Fort Cupar at that time. It’s one of
several reports he sent down from time to time pointing the
conditions of his district, and giving pretty red-hot accounts of
the terror which these Euralians had created there. But I’m not
going to worry you with all that stuff. I’ll simply tell you that
the terror of these folk was very real. That these marauders were
undoubtedly at that time a large well-organised outfit who had
completely succeeded in cleaning up the furs of that region and
were passing them over the Alaskan border into foreign hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a long report and I’m not going to read it to you.
I’m just going to hand it you in my own words. It’s a bad story,
but it’s full of an interest that’ll appeal to you. Fifteen years
ago there was a swell sort of missionary feller up at Fox Bluff,
a great friend of the man who wrote this report. His name was
Marty Le Gros. He wasn’t a real churchman, but just a good sort
of boy who was yearning to hand help to the Eskimo and Indians. I
gather, at the time this story occurred, he was a widower with a
baby girl of about four years. He also had an Indian called Usak,
and his squaw, working for him about his house. The squaw was
kind of foster-mother to the kid. Well, this report tells how in
chasing over the country visiting his Missions this Le Gros
happened on a most amazing gold ‘strike.’ It doesn’t say how or
just where. But it says that the missionary showed this factor
man two chunks of pure gold, and a bunch of dust that well nigh
paralysed him. Le Gros being a simple sort of feller didn’t worry
to keep his news to himself, but blurted his story broadcast, and
I gather the only thing he didn’t tell about it was the actual
whereabouts of the ‘strike.’ Apparently he let it be understood
that Loon Creek was the locality without giving any exact
particulars. This man gives such a brief sketch of this gold
business I sort of feel he wasn’t anxious to say too much. The
reason’s a bit obvious. And anyway I haven’t ever heard of a rush
in that direction. So the news never got around down here. But it
seems to have got to the ears of these Euralian poachers and set
them crazy to jump in on him with both feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now this is what happened,” Raymes went on, after a brief
reflective pause, while Bill sat still, absorbed in the interest
which the magic of a gold discovery had for him. His cigar had
gone out. “Up to that time the Euralians and their doings were
well enough known to these people, but only by hearsay. These
ruffians had never operated as far south-east as Fox Bluff and
Fort Cupar. Well, the missionary was out on the trail on a visit
to some of his Missions with his man, Usak. He arrived at one of
them on the Hekor. It was a settlement of fishing Indians. The
whole camp was burned out, and the old men, and women, and
infants had been butchered to death. Further, from their complete
absence, it is supposed the young men and women had been carried
off into captivity for slavery and harlotry. There was no doubt
of its being the work of these Euralians. The whole thing was
characteristic of every known story of them. Le Gros returned
home in a panic.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He came to McLeod and told him the story of it, and together
they realised that it was merely prelude to something further.
They got it into their heads that it was the Euralian method of
embarking on a campaign to get the secret of Le Gros’ gold
discovery. You see? Terror. They meant to terrorize Le Gros, and
I gather they succeeded. But he meant to fight. You see, he
reckoned this ‘strike’ was for his child. He wanted it for her.
Well, these two made it up between them to outwit these folk. The
missionary crossed the river to his home to prepare a map of his
discovery which he was to place in McLeod’s hands for the benefit
of his child and McLeod, in half shares, should anything happen
to him, Le Gros. Something did happen. It happened the same
night. Apparently before the map could be drawn. Sure enough the
Euralians descended on the missionary’s house. They killed Le
Gros, and they killed the squaw foster-mother. The Indian, Usak,
was away from home and so escaped. The child was left alive,
flung into an adjacent bluff, and the whole place was burned to
the ground. That’s the story in brief. I daresay there’s a heap
more to it, but it’s not in that report, and it’s not in
subsequent reports, or in other records of my predecessor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would seem that this boy, McLeod, died about eight years
after all this happened and was succeeded by another factor for
his company. In the meantime my predecessor had sent a patrol up
to investigate. The only result of this investigation was a
complete corroboration of McLeod’s report, with practically
nothing added to it beyond an urgent report on the necessity for
definite international action on the subject of these Euralians
who came in from Alaska. After that the thing seems to have
passed out of my predecessor’s hands. It seems it was taken up by
Ottawa with the usual result—pigeon-holed. Does it get you? There
it is, a great gold discovery, somewhere up there on the Hekor, I
suppose, and the mystery of this people filching our trade
through a process of outrageous crime. Somewhere up there there’s
a girl-child, white—she’d be about nineteen or twenty now—lost to
the white world to which she belongs. But above all, from my
point of view, there’s a problem. Who are these Euralians, and
what becomes of the wealth of furs they steal? Remember they were
at one time at least an <em>organised</em> outfit.” The policeman
replaced the file on his desk and returned the report to its
place. And the pre-occupation he displayed was a plain index of
the depth of interest he had in the problem which had presented
itself to his searching mind. Bill Wilder struck a match and
re-lit his cigar. “That’s a story of the country I know and
love,” he said quietly. “It’s a story of the real Northland. Not
the story of one of these muck-holes which are like boils in the
face of civilization. I guess you haven’t passed me the whole
thing you’ve got in your mind, George.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The policeman swung round in his chair and faced the clear
gazing grey eyes of the man whose enormous wealth had still left
him the youthful enthusiasm for the battle of the strong which
had first driven him to the outlands of the North.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you pass me the—rest?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure I will, if you’ve nothing to ask, nothing to comment on
that story.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’ll keep. Maybe I’ll have a whole big heap to talk when
you’re through with your—proposition.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Raymes nodded. He, too, was smiling. He spread out his
hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You want to quit. You want to sell out and pass on where you
can make some use of the life that’s creaking with rust in every
joint. Well, it’s easy. Don’t quit. Don’t sell out. Take a trip
north where there’s a big ‘strike’ waiting on a feller with a
nose for gold. Where there’s a mighty big mystery to be cleaned
up, and the hard justice of this iron country to be handed out to
a crowd of devils who’ve battened on its wealth and are sucking
the life out of its vitals. Is it good enough? You’ll be able to
forget the dollars you’re forced to count daily in this city.
You’ll lose sight of the Feldman crowd and the brothels they set
going to hand them a stake. It’s the open, where God’s pure air’s
blowing. Where there’s room for you to move, and breathe, and
live, and where you can hit mighty hard when the mood takes you,
and you can feel good all over that you’re doing something for
the country you like best. This thing’s my job, but I haven’t the
troops or time to fix it the way I should. I’m so crowded to the
square inch I don’t know how to breathe right. I haven’t any sort
of right offering you this thing. I know that, and I guess you’re
wise it’s so. But it don’t matter. I do offer it to you, Bill,
and it’s because I know you. I offer it you because you’re the
feller to put it through, and because you’re a feller we can’t
afford to lose out of our territory. Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The police officer’s manner had become seriously earnest, and
the other remained silent for some moments buried in deep
thought. George Raymes waited. He watched for the passing of the
gold man’s deep consideration. He understood that the thing he
required of him was no light task and looked like involving a
tremendous sacrifice.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last Bill’s cigar stump was flung into the cuspidor, and
the policeman realised that a decision had been arrived at. The
gold man looked up, and a whimsical smile lit his clear eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I was crazy enough to take a holt on this thing I don’t
just see—I’ve no authority. I’m no policeman. I’m just a bum
civilian without police training. You boys are red-hot on the
trail of crime. It’s your job, and I guess there’s no folk in the
world better at it. But—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve forgotten,” Raymes broke in. “There’s the trail of a
gold ‘strike’ in this. And Bill Wilder’s got the whole country
beaten a mile on a trail of that nature. Make that ‘strike’ an’ I
guess you’ll locate the rest in the process. I’m asking for that
from you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder laughed. It was the clear, ringing laugh of the youth
he really was. It was a laugh of appreciation at the simple
tactics of his friend. It was a laugh of rising enthusiasm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But the authority,” he protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>Raymes took him up on the instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have power to enrol ‘specials.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>The other’s grey eyes lit. Again his laugh rang out. “Yes. I
forgot. Of course you can enrol ‘specials.’” Suddenly he sprang
from the depths of the rocker, and left it violently disturbed.
He stood erect, bulking largely, and a flush of excitement dyed
his weather-stained cheeks. “Of course you can,” he cried. “Yes.
I’ll get after it. A gold trail! A bunch of toughs! A girl—a
white girl! Ye Gods! I’m after it. You can swear me in on any old
thing from a Bible to a harvester. That’s all I need. I’ll find
my own outfit, and I’ll get busy right away and collect up my old
partner Chilcoot Massy. I’ll get right off now down to my office
and start fixing things, and I’ll be back again after supper
to-night. But I warn you you’ll need to answer a hundred mighty
tiresome questions, and pass me all the literature you’ve
collected on this subject when I come back. Say, the gold trail
again! I’m just tickled to death.”</p>

    <div>THE CHEECHAKOS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The man was standing at the edge of the river
landing gazing out across the broad waters as they drifted slowly
by, a calm, gentle flood undisturbed by the rushing freshet of
spring, which had already spent its turbulent life leaving the
sedate Hekor embraced in the gentler arms of advancing
summer.</p>

<p class='c010'>The landing was little better than a wreck. The green log
piles were awry. There were rifts where last summer’s timbers had
been carried bodily away by the crash of ice at winter’s break
up. For the annual rebuilding necessitated by the tremendous
labour at the birth of the Arctic spring had been dispensed with.
There was no longer any need for it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s gaze was far-searching. It was seriously ruminating.
Perhaps, even, it was regretful. For he knew that in a few hours
all that he had looked out upon for the past seven years would
lay behind him, possibly never to be looked upon again.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mile-wide river lay open to the caressing sunlight. It was
unshaded anywhere. The far bank rose in a gentle slope, a perfect
carpet of wild flowers, and beyond, as the valley rose upwards,
the shimmer of summer heat bathed the purpling distance in an
almost dazzling haze. Away to his left, beyond the waters, stood
the dark spread of Fox Bluff, which gave the place its name, a
wide stretch of tattered forest, isolated on an undulating plain
many miles in extent. And the ruins of the old Mission House,
long since burned out by the Euralian marauders, still stood
gaunt and bare, a monument to the tragedy that was now some
fifteen years old.</p>

<p class='c010'>Behind him, well above the highest water level of the river,
the staunch walls of the stockade of old Fort Cupar still
sheltered the frame building which was about to be abandoned. But
already the place had assumed something of the lifelessness which
human desertion leaves in its wake. There were no Eskimo
encampments gathered about its timbers. There were no columns of
smoke arising from camp fires. The familiar yelp of trail dogs,
and the shrill voices of native children were silent. There was
no life anywhere but in the presence of the man on the landing,
and in that of the girl clad in native buckskin standing beside
him, and in the slow movements of five Indians and half-breeds
who, under the guidance of the factor, were completing the
stowage of cargo in the three canoes moored to the derelict
landing.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the day of the great retreat. It was the final yielding
after years of struggle. It was the giving up of that last thread
of hope which is the most difficult thing in human
psychology.</p>

<p class='c010'>Old Ben Needham was more than reluctant. He was a hard-bitten
fur-trader of the older school. A man of force and wide
experience. A man bred to the work, acute, rough, and not too
scrupulous. He had been born in the Arctic, schooled in the
Arctic, and only when the needs of his trade demanded had he ever
passed out of that magic circle. He was a man approaching sixty,
full of an aggressive fighting spirit which usually modifies in
men of advancing years. And he knew that he was about to
acknowledge complete defeat after seven years of battling against
invisible odds. He knew that the company had selected him out of
all their army of servants to attempt the rehabilitation of the
fortunes of Fort Cupar, and he had utterly and completely failed.
And so, as he stood on the landing superintending the last
removal of stores, and contemplating the return with his story of
failure to those who had sent him on his forlorn hope, his mood
was uneasy, his temper was sour and inclined to violence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The voice of the girl beside him roused him out of his
contemplation of the familiar scene.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You need Mum here to put heart into you, Ben,” she said with
a smile that masked her own feelings. “You know, Mum’s the wisest
thing in a country where fools are dead certain to go under.
She’d tell you there’s nothing so bad in the world as flogging a
dead mule. The feller who acts that way most generally gets
kicked to death by a live one. Which, I guess, is only another
way of saying it’s a fool’s game anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does she say that, Kid?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man turned from the scene that had so preoccupied him, and
his deep-set, hard grey eyes surveyed the speaker from beneath
his bushy, snow-white brows. For all his mood there was a sort of
mild tolerance in his tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl he addressed as Kid smiled blandly into his
unresponsive face, and her wide blue eyes were full of girlish
raillery. For all the sunburn on her rounded cheek, and the rough
make of her almost mannish clothing, or perhaps because of these
things, she was amazingly attractive. She was young. Something
less than twenty. But she was tall, taller than the broad figure
of the man beside her. And there was physical strength and vigour
in her graceful girlish body.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was clad in buckskin from her head to the reindeer
moccasins on her shapely feet. Her tunic, or parka, was tricked
out with beads and narrow fur trimmings in truly Indian fashion.
And the leather girdle about her slim waist supported a long
sheath knife, much as the native hunters were equipped. But she
was white, with fair curling hair coiled in a prodigal mass under
her fur cap, with wide, smiling eyes that rivalled the blue of
the summer sky, and a nose as perfectly modelled, and lips as
warm and ripe as any daughter of the more southern latitudes. Her
manner was easy and self-reliant. It was full of that cool
assurance bred of the independence which the hard life of the
Northland forces upon its children. Nature had equipped her with
splendid generosity, and the man understood that her sex robbed
her of nothing that could make her his equal in understanding of
the conditions in which their lives were cast.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl laughed gaily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She says a whole lot of things, Ben,” she cried. “But then
you see she’s the mother of six bright kids who’re yearning to
learn, and she doesn’t guess to let them down, or have them tell
her instead. Yes, she said that sure, when we were wondering how
your quitting was going to fix us. You see, I’ve depended on your
store for trade. I guess I was the only supply of pelts that came
your way. And you were the only supply for our needs. Your folks
are right,” she added, with a sigh. “You can’t run a trading post
to hand out to a bunch of kids the stuff that makes life
reasonable, and for the sake of the few bales of furs we’re able
to snatch before they fall into the hands of foreign poachers. It
was sure flogging a dead mule. But it’s going to be tough. It’s
going to be tough for us, as well as for you and your folk. I’ve
tried to look ahead and see what’s to be done, but I can’t see
all I’d like to. Mum reckons we’ll get through, but she leaves it
to Providence and me to say how.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man bit off a chew of tobacco and shouted some orders at
the men stowing the last of the stores. His words came forcefully
amidst a shower of harsh expletives. Then he turned again to the
girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d say your Mum’s as bright a woman as the good God ever
permitted to use up his best air,” he said, with a shake of his
grey head. “But I just can’t see how trading reindeer with the
fool Eskimo up north’s goin’ to feed a whole bunch of hungry
mouths, and clothe a dandy outfit of growin’ bodies right, if
there ain’t a near-by market for your goods, and a store to trade
you the things you need. There ain’t a post from here to Placer,
which is more than three hundred and fifty miles by the river. It
kind o’ looks bad to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The smile had passed out of the girl’s eyes, and her fair
brows had drawn slightly together under the rim of her fur
cap.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see, Kid,” the man went on, in a tone that was almost
gentle for all the natural harshness of his voice, “I’d be mighty
glad to fix you as right as things’ll let me. We’ve figgered on
this thing all we know, you and me, and you’ve a year’s store of
canned goods and groceries by you paid for by your last bunch of
pelts. But after that—what?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The swift glance of the Kid’s eyes took in the earnest
expression of the man’s rugged face. She realised his genuine
concern in spite of all the worries with which his own affairs
beset him. And forthwith she broke into a laugh that completely
disarmed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll need to feed caribou meat,” she said. “The farm’s plumb
full of it. Mum says the good God’s always ready to help those
who help themselves. And I guess the bunch at home’ll do that
surely when they find their vitals rattling in the blizzard.
Don’t just worry a thing, Ben. You’ve done the best for us, you
know. For all the grouch you hand out to most folk you’re white
all thro’. You’re forgetting there’s Usak and me. If it means
Placer for trade and food for the bunch I guess we’ll make
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s laugh, and her lightness of manner in her dismissal
of the threat overshadowing her future and that of those who were
largely her care made their talk easy. But there was seriousness
and a great courage lying behind it. She knew the nightmare this
break up of her market was to all those she cared for. But she
had no intention of adding one single moment of disquiet to the
burden of the man’s concern for his own future.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it’s a hell of a long piece, Kid,” the factor protested
with a shake of his shaggy grey head. “Couldn’t you folks quit
too?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl shook her head while her blue eyes were turned on the
broad expanse of water where it vanished in the south. Perhaps it
was the trend of their talk which had attracted her gaze in that
direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely we could quit if—we had the notion,” she said, after a
moment’s reflection. “But what if we did? I mean how would it
help? Maybe I don’t know. Placer? What if we made Placer where
there’s food and trade? What could we do? There’s Mum, and my six
little brothers and sisters, running up like a step-ladder from
inches to feet. Then there’s Usak, an Indian man who’s got no
equal as a pelt hunter and trailman. Here we’re lords over a
limitless territory. We’ve a herd of deer that runs into
thousands, and reindeer are the beginning and end of everything
to the Eskimo, but wouldn’t be worth dog meat in Placer. Show me.
I’m ready to think. We can go on making out right here if we only
make one trip a year to Placer. If we quit, I guess there’d be
nothing but the dance halls of Placer you’ve told me about for me
and my little sisters as they grow up, while Usak, with a temper
like a she-wolf, would run foul of half the city in a week. No.
You said a thing once to me, Ben, that’s stuck in my stupid head
since. What was it? ‘The North’s big, an’ free, an’ open, an’
clean. The longer you know it the more you’ll curse it. But the
feller who’s bred to it can’t go back on it. There’s no place on
God’s earth for him outside it but the hell of perdition.’ I
guess that fits my notion of—Say, there’s an outfit coming up out
of the south.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl broke off.</p>

<p class='c010'>She stood pointing out over the water where the river seemed
to rise out of the distance between two low hill breasts. A group
of canoes, infinitely small in the distance, had suddenly leapt
into view.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man became absorbed in the unaccustomed vision. He raised
a gnarled hand, broad and muscular for all its leanness, and
shaded his eyes from the sun-glare. After a moment he dropped it
to his side. A grim, cynical light shone in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cheechakos,” he said in profound contempt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How d’you know?” The girl was full of that interest and
curiosity bred of the solitude in which she lived.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’re loaded down with truck so they look like swamping.
It’s a big outfit, an’ they look mighty like they’ve bought up
haf the dry goods the gold city can scratch together. Yes.
They’re Cheechakos, sure. An’ they’re huntin’ the gold trail. I
can locate ’em at a hundred miles. I’ve seen ’em come, but most
generally go, on every blamed river runnin’ north of Dawson.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl laughed lightly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To listen to you, Ben, folk might guess you hadn’t feeling
softer than tamarack for a thing in the world. I want to laugh
sure. Sometimes I feel I could shake you till the bones rattled
in your tough old body. Then I remember. An’ I—I don’t want to do
a thing but laff. If you’re not through with your outfit, and
beating it down the river by the time those folk happen along
I’ll gamble a caribou cow to a gopher you’ll be handing them just
anything you reckon they need, if it’s only the wise old talk I
know you’re full up to the brim with. You can’t bluff me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl shook her head and her eyes were full of a smiling,
almost motherly tenderness for the strong man of many years who
was tasting the bitterness of real defeat. She had known him from
the day he first set foot at Fort Cupar with that sort of family
intimacy which is part of the life of the great solitudes. She
had been a child then. Now she was a grown woman with a mind that
was simply serious despite her ready laugh, and a heart full of
deep, womanly sympathy. All life and hope still lay before her.
This man had gone far beyond the meridian of both. He was rapidly
approaching those declining years with a great failure to his
credit, and she realised the tragedy of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said. “I guess I can’t bluff you, Kid. You’re kind of
nimble.” His eyes were still on the approaching outfit. “I
wonder,” he went on. “That wise old talk you reckon I’m full of.
Do you fancy me passing it to you before I quit, instead of to
that bunch of Cheechakos?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl nodded with a twinkling smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure,” she said. “I’d feel jealous you handing it to the
others.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Ben Needham laughed in that short, dry fashion which was his
limit of hilarious expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, you best pull your freight out of here before that
bunch of Cheechakos come alongside. Ther’s a whole heap o’ things
you know, but a sight bigger heap of the things you don’t know.
The junk that comes up out of Placer is mostly junk, mean, human
junk. The men of the gold trail ain’t like the metal they’re
chasing, except in the colour of their livers. One of the things
I haven’t figgered you’re wise to is you’re a gal of nigh twenty,
and you’ve a face that smiles like spring sunshine, and the sort
of eyes that makes a man feel like shooting up the other feller.
Do you get me? Beat it, my dear. You’ve a Mum, an’ you’ve got a
dandy bunch of brothers an’ sisters. You’ve got a home way out
there on the Caribou River that ain’t ever known a thing but what
a good woman can make it. Wal, keep things that way. But you
won’t do it if the muck of the gold trail hits your tracks.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s smile had passed as she watched the old man
expectorate into the clear waters at his feet. She remained
completely silent while, in an utterly changed tone, he hurled
violent expletives at his workers. She looked on while he passed
down to where the lashings were being made fast on the last canoe
whose load had just been completed. When he came back her
thoughtful mood had passed, and her smile was supreme once
more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d wanted to see you start out, Ben,” she said gently. “You
know it’s hard not to be able to speed a real friend, when—when—
But there, it’s no use. The kids are needin’ me, so’s Mum, and
Usak and the deer. You’re so slow getting away I just can’t
stop.” Her gaze wandered again to the approaching outfit, and it
was a little regretful, and something wistful. “Are all the men
of the gold trail tough? I mean are they just all bad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The grey head denied her. The man’s cynical smile twinkled in
his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The men ain’t no better, an’ no worse than most of us,” he
said slily. “That is till they get the yellow fever of it all.
When that gets around they’re mighty sick folk till the fever
passes. Guess your memory don’t carry you back to the days when
you weren’t more than knee-high to a grasshopper. If it did maybe
you’d be wise to the thing that’s got a mighty big place in your
dandy life. It’s gold. The yarns I’m told say it was gold that
robbed you of a father. It was gold that left you helpless, feed
for the coyotes that didn’t find you. It was gold,” he went on,
pointing across the river, “that left them burnt out sticks,
which one time was your rightful home. Gold, I guess, has played
a mighty tough part in your life, Kid, and maybe it ain’t goin’
to let up. That’s the way of things. I’d say you ain’t done with
gold yet. You see, ther’s the story of that ‘strike’ your father
made, an’—lost. No,” he added thoughtfully. “It’s goin’ to come
back on you. An’ that’s why I say beat it. Don’t wait around for
those folks comin’ up the river. They got the fever bad, I guess,
or they wouldn’t be makin’ a country that’s cursed by the
Euralian fur poachers. Yes. Beat it, Kid. Light out. They’re
comin’ right in.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The swift stroke reached its length. The Kid lifted the paddle
from the water and laid it across the little vessel in front of
her. Resting against the paddling strut she craned round and
gazed back over the shining waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had passed the wooded bend of the river, and the
far-reaching shelter of Fox Bluff completely shut her off from
observation at the Fort. The landing was hidden; so, too, were
the three great canoes that were to carry the defeated factor and
his outfit down the river to those who quite possibly would have
no further use for his services.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even the Fort itself, on the higher ground of the opposite
bank, was no longer visible.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl was satisfied. She returned to her labours, for the
drift of the stream had carried her canoe back some few
yards.</p>

<p class='c010'>It shot forward again, however, under the skilful strokes of
her strong young arms, and the water rippled and sang as it smote
the sharp cutwater that drove into it. Three miles farther on she
had reached the limits of the great woods, and the turbulent
rapids came into view.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were the rapids at the junction of the two rivers. It was
here that the Caribou River disgorged itself upon the flood of
the greater river. A wide litter of frothing, churning popple
disported itself over the shallows at the mouth of the invading
stream. In the passage of time, the Caribou had battled its way
up out of the south-east. It had broken into the sedate course of
the Hekor diagonally, meeting its stream defiantly. Final
overwhelming had been its lot, in the process of which a vast
stretch of sheltering banks had been washed completely out and
transformed into treacherous shoals. It was the girl’s immediate
objective.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again she ceased from her labours and gazed smilingly over the
distant view. It was alight with a lavish wealth of colour, the
vivid hues of Arctic blossoms with which the ripening sun of
spring had set the whole country ablaze. Her smile was full of
girlish enjoyment. For she was thinking of the wise, friendly,
cynical old Ben Needham and his earnest warning.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was thinking of him in no spirit of ridicule, but she knew
she meant to disregard his warning utterly. It was the youth in
her. It was the girlish curiosity and a spirit of independence
that urged her. The world beyond was a sort of dream place of
wonder to her; a book whose pages were sealed lest her eyes
should seek the things that were there written. He had warned her
that these folk coming up out of the south were the Cheechakos of
the gold trail. He was probably right, but at least they were
white folk who belonged to that world from which she was wholly
cut off. It was an opportunity she had no intention of missing.
She would transform herself into something resembling the
creatures of the shy world to which she belonged. She would lie
hidden, and gaze upon these strange and terrible people from
another world, against whom she had been so gravely warned.</p>

<p class='c010'>She turned her little vessel sharply towards the bank of the
river where it rose high, and the last of Fox Bluff projected a
dense mass of Arctic willow which hung down, a perfect screen,
till the delicate foliage buried itself in the bosom of the
stream. A few swift strokes of her paddle and she passed from
view behind it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The nose of her vessel was securely resting on the sticky mud
of the bank. She had turned about. And now she sat waiting,
peering out through the foliage as might some hunted silver fox,
whose pelt was one of the chief objects of her trade. She gave no
sign, she made no sound. She had no intention of revealing her
presence. But she would see for herself the thing she must shun,
the thing whose presence in her home she must always deny.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a long waiting, but it mattered nothing. The daylight
was almost unending now, and anyway time had small enough bearing
on the simple affairs of her life. She had time for the
indulgence of every whim, and the youth in her prompted a full
measure of such indulgence.</p>

<p class='c010'>A happy excitement thrilled her. Everything that lifted her
out of the humdrum routine of her life on the farm became an
exhilarating excitement. She was completely happy in her life.
She was happy in her support of the mother woman labouring in her
home for her many offspring, she was happy in her association
with the Indian, Usak, whose untiring labours had built up the
great reindeer farm of which he had assured her she was mistress.
But her mind was groping amongst a world of girlish dreams,
yearning and full of unspoken, unadmitted desires. A subtle
restlessness was at work in her, and it found expression in the
impulse which had become so irresistible. All her life had been
bounded by narrow limits of association. Her only human
associations had always been those of her far-off home, and the
trading post with its factor, and those men of the fur trail who
foregathered about its staunch walls. Here, for the first time,
was something new. And more than all it was something that was
prohibited.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The two men were gazing out at the churning waters storming
over the shoals, and the outlook was threatening. They were
standing on the low bank, trampling underfoot the carpet of
flowers which grew in profusion down to the very edge of the
river. They were surveying the junction of the two rivers where
the Caribou broke its way into the flood of the Hekor, and the
endless battle of conflicting streams was being fought out. The
cauldron of boiling rapids extended for nearly two miles.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder raised a sunburnt hand and crushed the blood glutted
bodies of half a hundred mosquitoes on the back of his powerful
neck.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s portage, sure, Chilcoot,” he said, with that finality
which denoted a mind made up. “I don’t see a passage anywhere fit
to take the big boats. I’d say the stream’s deep this side under
the bank, but we can’t chance things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot Massy chewed on for a moment in deep contemplation.
He was a silent creature, squat, powerful and grey-headed, with
the hard-beaten face of a pugilist. He was a product of the
northern gold trail whose experience went far back to the first
rush over the Skagway in ’98, and looked it all in the rough
buckskin and cord clothing in which he was clad. He was Bill
Wilder’s chief lieutenant; a man whose force and courage was
unabated for all his years, and whose restless spirit denied him
the comfort and leisure which the ample wealth he had achieved in
association with his friend and one-time employer, entitled him
to.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It certainly looks that way,” he agreed. Then he demurred.
“You never can tell on these rivers,” he said. “We’d have done a
heap better breaking down our outfit, an’ takin’ on a bigger
bunch of lighter canoes. Maybe we’ll run into this sort of stuff
right away up the river as we get nearer the headwaters.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That trader feller didn’t reckon that way,” he said. “There
isn’t a thing to worry from here to the Great Falls,” he said.
“And Loon Creek is twenty miles this side of them. We’re liable
to find it tough on the creek. But that’s not new. We’ll be at
work then with a fixed headquarters, and we can travel light. Ben
Needham said we could get through this stuff if we fancied taking
a chance. He guessed if we knew it there wasn’t any sort of
chance about it. Well, we don’t know it. And I’m taking no
chances. You see, there’s more to this thing than chasing a
simple gold trail.” He laughed. “Guess we aren’t civilians any
longer. We’re police. You and me, and Mike. And we’ve got our
orders from our superiors who don’t stand for disobedience. We’re
being paid a dollar a day to make good. And I don’t reckon the
police pay out such a powerful bunch of money to folks to make a
failure. Come right on. We’ll get back and eat. Then we’ll start
in on the portage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>They re-traced their steps to the camp that had been pitched
well below the rough waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a busy scene. The five great laden canoes were moored
nose on to the bank, and two smaller vessels were drawn up clear
of the water on the mud. It was an imposing fleet, equipped to
the last detail, and old Ben Needham had done it less than
justice when he had contemptuously characterised it for the
benefit of the Kid. This was no Cheechako outfit laden with the
useless equipment engendered of inexperience.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was an equipment such as only the wide experience of Wilder
and Chilcoot could have designed. It was made up of everything
which the outlands of the North demanded, from dogs and sleds to
a miniature army of Breeds and hard-living whitemen, armed to
encounter human hostility as well as the fiercest onslaughts of
Nature’s most antagonistic moods. Furthermore, full preparation
for a long sojourn in an inhospitable region had been made.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hot food had been made ready when they reached the camp, and
dogs and men were busily engaged satisfying keen appetite for all
the fierce heat of the day and the shadelessness prevailing
everywhere. The leader’s camp had been set apart, and Red Mike, a
red-haired, giant Irishman, whose only sober moments were
breathed beyond the drink-laden atmosphere of the dance halls of
Placer, was awaiting their return. He was third in command, and
his responsibility was that of quartermaster, and river man, and
for the discipline of the ruffian crew of the expedition. His
greeting was characteristic.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Chance is the salt of life,” he cried, in a pleasant brogue,
addressing Wilder. “Are we takin’ it, boss?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then sure you’ll set in an’ eat,” was the prompt retort.
“Guess portage was invented by the divil himself, an’ the Holy
Fathers don’t reckon we need to get in a hurry knockin’ at Hell’s
gates. This sow-belly’s as tough as dried snakes. I don’t seem to
notice even the flies yearning. Tea? Gee! It’s poor sort of
hooch, even when you’ve skimmed the stewed flies clear. I—Mother
of Snakes! Wher’ did that come from?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s blue eyes were turned on the shining waters. His
roving gaze had been caught by the sight of a small hide kyak
heading for the camp. It was propelled by a single paddle dipping
in the noiseless fashion which belongs to the river Indians. And
he squatted with a mouthful of sow-belly poised ready to be
devoured.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot had flung his length on the ground, but Bill Wilder
was still standing. His eyes were turned at once on the
approaching vessel.</p>

<p class='c010'>Red Mike laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That trader guy’s sent us along a scout,” he said. “He’s a
reas’nable sort of citizen. I guess that Injun’s goin’ to save us
portage.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Needham was all in beating it down river. And anyway—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He wouldn’t be passin’ us along a <em>white gal</em> to show
us them rapids.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot was sitting up. His hard face was wearing a grin that
might well have seemed impossible to it. And he spoke with an
assurance that brought the Irishman to his feet, with his food
thrown aside as though it were the last thing to be desired at
such a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>The kyak approached the bank within some twenty yards. Then
with a thrust of the paddle the Kid held it up and sat
contemplating the men on the shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole camp was agog. The crews lounging over their rough
trail food watched the intruder curiously. But seemingly they had
missed, in the sunburnt figure, clad in familiar mannish
buckskin, the thing which the lightning eye of Chilcoot had
discovered on the instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder and Red Mike passed hastily down the bank while the
older man followed more leisurely.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was just a little difficult. Once the men reached the
waterside Chilcoot’s assertion was left beyond question. Had the
intruder been a man, greeting and possible invitation would have
been forthcoming on the instant. As it was even the Irishman was
reduced to silence in sheer amazement. The girl was less than
twenty yards away beyond the vessels moored, a rampart between
herself and the Cheechakos against whom the factor had warned
her. Her beautiful blue eyes were unsmiling. Her sunburnt face
was almost painfully serious. And her whole manner, and her
attitude told the men on the bank that her approach had definite
meaning which had nothing to do with idle curiosity. So they
waited, and finally the difficulty was solved by the girl
herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re getting ready for portage?” she called across the
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Wilder who replied to her, and a smile lit his angular
face as he noted the sweetly girlish tones of the voice that
reached him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t need to,” came back the Kid’s prompt reply, and her
paddle stirred in the water and her little vessel crept in
towards the laden canoes. “There’s a deep channel. It’s right
along under the bank, and it’ll take the biggest boat you’ve got
without a worry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder stepped on to the nearest vessel and moved down its
length. The prow of the girl’s canoe had come within a yard of
him, and he looked down into the wide eyes gazing so confidently
up into his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s just kind of you,” he said, in a tone he intended
should escape the listening ears behind him. “It’s a mighty big
proposition portaging this outfit, and I was feeling kind of
reluctant.” He withdrew his gaze from the fascinating picture of
the white girl in the boat and glanced in the direction she had
indicated. “The channel cuts in under this bank, you say? And
it’s clear all the way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid’s bright eyes were measuring. In her mind was the
haunting memory of old Ben’s warning, but somehow it was
powerless before her inclination and the sight of this large man
with his steady, good-looking eyes, and wholesome, clean-shaven
face. Her confidence increased and her impulse became
irresistible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you feel like it I’ll give you a lead,” she said. “I know
it by heart. You see,” she added, with simple conclusiveness, “I
was raised on this river.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded. His smiling eyes had come back again to the
girl’s face as she sat with her paddle stirring in the water to
keep her place against the stream.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did Ben Needham send you along?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, no,” the Kid denied frankly. “I just saw you pass up
stream and guessed you were strangers. So—” She broke off. In a
moment she realised her mistake from the flash of inquiry she saw
in the man’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t remember passing you on the river,” he said
quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s moment of confusion passed, and frank impulse again
took hold of her. She laughed happily, and the man felt the
infection of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I saw you coming an’ took cover,” she said simply. “I guessed
you were Cheechakos and reckoned I’d take a look—at a
distance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you take—cover? There wasn’t need?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.” The Kid shook her head a little dubiously. “There wasn’t
real need. Only—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, anyway I’ll be glad to pass you through the rapids if
it’ll help you. It’ll save you more than a day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll be grateful. I—wonder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see, my name’s Wilder—Bill Wilder. And I was wondering
what yours was.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the girl broke into a happy laugh and the gold man, in
sheer delight, joined in. Somewhere out of the blue a pretty
white girl, with blue eyes and a wealth of fair hair, clad in the
vividly ornamented buckskin which he associated only with the
Indian, had descended upon him at a time and place when he had
only looked for the roughness of the northern trail. It was all a
little amazing. It was all rather absurd. And she was offering to
pass him practical help in the work in which he had always
believed himself complete master.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m—the Kid,” she returned presently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that your name?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl shook her head and her smile was irresistible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” she said. “But it’s how I’m known all along the
river.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I guess it’s good enough for me.” Bill Wilder drew a
quick breath. “Well, Kid,” he went on with a smile, “we were just
about to eat. Will you step ashore and join us? Then, after, I’ll
be mighty glad to have you pass us up those rapids.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The smile died abruptly out of the girl’s eyes. She remembered
Ben Needham and his warning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re Cheechakos—on the gold trail?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill laughed. The whole position suddenly dawned on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said. “No, Kid. We’re an outfit on the gold trail,
sure,” he went on quite seriously. “But we’re decent citizens.
And there’s not a thing to this camp to scare you. Will you come
right ashore?”</p>

<p class='c010'>For answer the girl’s paddle stirred more deeply and the nose
of her canoe shot up to the vessel on which the man was standing.
He held out one brown hand to assist her, but it was ignored. The
Kid rose to her feet, tall and beautifully slim, and sprang on to
the vessel beside him, carrying her own mooring rope of rawhide
in her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m kind of glad you ain’t—Cheechakos,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>And they both laughed as they passed back together over the
bales of outfit with which the boat was laden, and reached the
river bank where Chilcoot and Mike were waiting for them.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c001'>
    <div>REINDEER FARM</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Indian, Usak, and the Kid were standing in the
great enclosure where three half-breed Eskimos were engaged in
the operation of breaking young buck reindeer to the sled work of
the trail. They took no part in it. It was the daily occupation
in the springtime of the year. It began before the break-up of
winter, when it was conducted with heavily weighted sleds, and,
with the passing of the snow it was continued with the long pole
carryalls, which is the Eskimo means of transport over land in
summer. The carryall was in use now and it was an interesting
struggle between the skill of the squat, sturdy, brown-skinned
breakers, and the half-scared, half-angry fighting will of a
finely grown buck deer whose ragged coat of winter gave him the
size of a three-year-old steer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Haltered, and ranged along the rough-poled fence of the great
corral stood twenty or thirty young bucks awaiting their turn in
the rawhide harness, and they gazed round on the spectacle of
their fighting brother with eyes of mild wonder at the commotion
he was creating. Otherwise they seemed utterly unconcerned in
their gentle submissiveness. They were all man-handled and tame.
They had been handled almost from their birth, for the whole
success of the farm depended on the turning out of fully broken
cattle, trained for the work of transport within the Arctic,
where the Eskimo estimate them above every other means of
traversing the vast spaces of snow and ice, or the barren,
lichen-grown territory of summer over which they were wont to
roam.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great deer was quieting down. His sense of the indignity
of the forked carryall resting on his high withers seemed to be
passing. His wild jumps and slashing forefeet were less violent,
and his snortings of fear and anger were replaced by meaningless
shakings of the graceful head on which his annual re-growth of
antlers was only just beginning to display itself. Finally, under
the skilful handling of the breakers, good-temper prevailed, and
the beautiful creature was induced to move forward dragging the
boulder-weighted poles with their ends resting on the ground.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Him good buck,” Usak said approvingly, as the men led the now
docile creature round the circle of the breaking track.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid had nothing to add. Truth to tell for once she had
little interest in the work the result of which represented the
livelihood, the whole fortunes of them all. Her thoughts were far
away, somewhere miles along the broad course of the Hekor River.
She was thinking of her previous day’s adventure, and her pretty
eyes reflected her thoughts. Somehow her mood had lost its
buoyancy. Somehow the years of happy life on this far-off
northern homestead seemed to have dropped away behind her.
Something had broken the spell of it. Something had robbed it of
half its simple, happy associations.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gazing upon the mild-eyed creature now gracefully pacing the
well-worn track under the careful guidance of the dark-skinned
men of the North, she was thinking of a pair of clear-gazing,
fearless honest eyes which had looked into hers with a man’s
kindly smile for something more weak and tender than himself, for
something that stirred his sense of chivalry to its deepest. She
understood nothing of his emotions, and little enough of her own.
She only remembered the smile and the kindness, and the man whose
outfit she had unfalteringly guided up the open channel of the
river where it skirted the deadly rapids. And somehow, her
adventure marked an epoch in her life which had completely broken
the hitherto monotonous continuity of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder. The man’s name was no less graven on her memory
than was the recollection of his great stature and the lean face
which had so re-assured her of the honesty and ability which old
Ben Needham’s warning had denied him. She remembered the half
hour she had squatted in company of these men, sharing in their
rough, midday meal, and listening to, and taking part, in their
talk. It had been a thrilling excitement, not one detail of which
would she have missed for all the world. It had been a
deliriously happy time. She remembered how the man called Mike
had pressed her to say where she lived, and to tell them the name
to which she was born, and she remembered the sharp fashion in
which, at the first sign of reluctance on her part, remembering
as she had Ben’s warning, Bill Wilder had told him to mind his
business.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then had come her little moment of triumph when she had passed
the outfit up the open channel. How she had nursed it, and
delivered her orders to the men behind. How she had taken Wilder
himself a passenger in her pilot kyak, and left him wondering at
her skill and knowledge. Then had come the parting with her new
friends, when the man had told her in his quiet assured fashion
that someday they would meet again when his work was done.
Someday he would come back, perhaps in two years, and wait by the
rapids till she appeared. And then on the impulse of the moment
she had said there would be no need for him to wait by the
rapids. All he had to do was to turn off into the mouth of the
Caribou River and pass some ten miles up its course.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was wondering and dreaming now. Her wonder was if the man
would remember his promise, and her simply given invitation. And
her dreaming was of a steady pair of grey eyes that haunted her
no matter where she gazed and robbed her of all interest in the
things which had never before failed to hold her deepest
concern.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We mak fifty buck ready,” Usak went on, failing to realise
the girl’s abstraction. “Fifty good dam buck. An’ I mak north an’
mak plenty big trade. Yes?” He shook his head, and his dark eyes,
a shade more sunken with the passing of years, but lacking
nothing of the passionate fire of his earlier days, took on a
moody light. “Us mak no good plenty trade no more. No. I go east,
’way nor-east plenty far. All time more far as I go. What I mak?
Fox? Yes. Beaver? Yes. Maybe I mak wolf bear. I mak small truck.
No seal. No ivory. No anything good. Now I mak none. Not little
bit. Him Euralian mak east. All time him go east, too. Him eat up
all fur. Eskimo all much scare. Him go all time farther. So I not
mak him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s half angry protest impressed itself upon the girl.
Her pre-occupied gaze came back to his dark, saturnine face. An
ironical smile played for a moment in the blue of her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does it matter, Usak?” she asked. “Old Ben Needham has gone,
an’ the store’s closed down. If you made good trade I guess we’d
be left with it piling in our store.” She shook her head almost
disconsolately. “Ther’s only Placer for us now. We’ll need to
make the trip once a year, and trade the small truck we can
scratch together. It’s that or—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl broke off. Ben Needham had gone. Bill Wilder and his
party had vanished up the river. Quite suddenly the desolation of
it all seemed complete.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was moisture in her eyes as she turned from the man’s
dark face to the familiar scenes about her. The wide Caribou
River Valley was bright green with a wealth of summer grass and
tiny flowers which the spring floods had left behind them. The
river was shrunken now to its normal bed in the heart of the
valley, which was walled in by high shoulders separated by nearly
two miles of flat. So it went on for many miles; sometimes
narrowing, sometimes widening. Sometimes the valley was almost
barren of all but the Arctic lichens. Sometimes it was filled
with wind-swept pine bluffs, often dwarfed, but occasionally
extensive and of primordial characteristics. The farm was set in
a deep shelter of a bluff of the latter kind. The house lay
behind them, nestling just within great lank trees that in turn
were sheltered by a granite spur of the great walls which lined
the course of the valley. It was a crude but snug enough home. It
was a structure that had grown as the mood and ability of Usak,
and the needs of those who had elected to share it with him, had
prompted.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was seven years since the change had taken place. Before
that, for eight long years, it had been the home of the child
Felice and her Indian, self-appointed, guardian. Usak had been as
good as his word. Felice had been left to the care of Hesther and
Jim McLeod while he went on his mission of vengeance after he had
been left wifeless, and Felice had been left a helpless orphan.
He had returned as he said he would. He had returned to claim the
orphaned child of his “good boss.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The whiteman and his wife had been reluctant. They had
realised their duty. Usak was an Indian, and they felt that in
giving the child into his keeping they were committing a serious
wrong.</p>

<p class='c010'>But it so happened that with the return of Usak from his
journey into the great white void of the North, the story of
which he refused to reveal, Hesther’s first baby was about to be
born. And the coming of that new life pre-occupied both husband
and wife to the exclusion of all else, and helped to blind them
to their sense of duty. So the Indian’s appeal had double force.
And finally they yielded, convinced of the man’s honesty,
convinced that in denying him they would have inflicted a
grievous wound on the already distraught creature.</p>

<p class='c010'>So Usak had come into possession of the treasure he claimed as
an offset to the monstrous grief of his own personal loss, and he
set about the task of raising the child with the inimitable
devotion of a single-minded savage.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man had laboured for her with every waking moment. He had
laboured to replace the mother woman who had nursed her, and the
great white father whom he had loved. He had laboured to build up
about her the farm which was to yield her that means of
livelihood which his simple understanding warned him that Marty,
himself, would have desired for her.</p>

<p class='c010'>It had been a great struggle with his limited education and
only his savage mind to guide him in the barter which was the
essence of the success he desired. Then, too, with each passing
year the depredations of the invading Euralians spread wider and
wider afield as the central control, which apparently had always
existed, seemed to lose its grip on the rapidly increasing
numbers of the foreign marauders. Futhermore, his trade with the
little people of the Arctic had in consequence receded farther
and farther, till, as he had just said, it had passed almost
beyond his reach.</p>

<p class='c010'>So things had gone on till eight years had passed and the dark
eyes of the man saw the womanly development of the pretty white
child. Then had happened another one of those strokes of
ill-fortune which so often react in a direction quite
undreamed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther and Jim McLeod had developed a family of three boys
and three girls in the course of the eight years. Trade was bad,
and the threat of closing down the store was always hanging over
them. Then, one day, in the depths of the terrible Arctic winter,
the man was taken ill with pneumonia, and, in a week, Hesther was
left a widow with six small children and no one to turn to for
support and comfort, and with little more in the world than the
shelter of the store, and such food as it provided, until the Fur
Valley Company should remove her and replace her dead husband
with a new Factor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Company dealt fairly, if coldly, with her. Ben Needham was
sent up to replace the dead Jim McLeod at the opening of spring.
And the widow and her children were to be brought down to Dawson,
and, forthwith sent on to such destination as she desired. The
Company gave her travelling expenses, and a sum of money to help
her along. And that was to be the limit of its obligations.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hesther McLeod had definite ideas. Her cheerful optimism
and gentle philosophy never for a moment deserted her. During the
dark months of winter, when she was left with only the ghost of
her dead, she strove with all the calm she possessed to review
the thing which life had done to her. She was quite unblinded to
the seriousness of her position. She probed to the last detail
all it meant to those lives belonging to her which were only just
beginning. And finally the decision she took had nothing in it of
the promptings of hard sense, but came from somewhere deep down
in a gentle, brave, motherly heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>She would not quit the country in which had been consummated
all the joys of motherhood. Her children were of the North, and
should be raised men and women of the great wide country which
had yielded her all the real emotions of her life. She would
stay. She would take the pittance which the Company offered, but
the North should remain her home. And curiously enough the main
thought prompting her heroic decision was the memory of the white
girl she had handed over to the care of the Indian, Usak.</p>

<p class='c010'>The rest had been easy to a creature of her simple practice.
Usak was forthwith consulted, and the loyal creature jumped at
the idea that the whitewoman and her children should make their
home on the farm he was so ardently labouring to build up for the
daughter of his “good boss.”</p>

<p class='c010'>In short order the three-roomed log shanty grew. It spread out
in any convenient direction under the man’s indefatigable
labours, and the mother’s domestic mind. A room here was added. A
room there. And so it went on, regardless of all proportion, but
with keen regard for necessity and convenience. And Hesther
brought all her chattels with her from the store, and her busy
hands and invincible courage swiftly turned the place into a real
home for the children, and everything else calculated for the
well-being of the lives it was her cherished desire to do her
best for.</p>

<p class='c010'>So in the course of years, sometimes under overwhelming
difficulties, Felice, who, from the start had been affectionately
designated “the Kid” had grown up to womanhood, taught to read
and write and sew by Hesther, and made adept in the laborious
work of the farm and trail and river by Usak.</p>

<p class='c010'>And through every struggle, under the radiance of the mother’s
courage and sweetness of temper, and watched over by the fierce
dark eyes of the devoted Indian, it had always been a home of
happiness and hope. And this despite the fact that every factor
to make for hope was steadily diminishing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian was in the mood for plain speaking now. And the
Kid, her mind disturbed out of its usual calm by her recent
adventure, was eagerly responsive.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian shook his head so that his lank hair swept the
greasy collar of his buckskin shirt.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The good boss your father, him speak much wise. Him say—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know,” the Kid broke in impulsively, and with some
impatience. “Guess you’ve told me before. ‘When the fox sheds his
coat the winds blow warm.’ We know about that, don’t we?” She
smiled for all her real distress. “But I’d say Nature’s mighty
little to do with human trade. When ther’s no food in the house
we’ll have to go hungry, or live on caribou meat. Say, can you
see us sitting around with the wind whistling through our bones?
Does the notion tell you anything? It won’t blow warmer because
Mary Justicia, an’ Clarence, an’ Algernon, an’ Percy, an’ Gladys
Anne, an’ Jane Constance are hungry. It won’t be so bad for
mother, an’ me, an’ you. We’re grown. And it won’t be the first
time we’ve been hungry. No. It’s no use. You and me, we’ll have
to make Placer, where the folks drink and gamble, and dance, most
all the time, and, when they get the chance, rob the folks who
don’t know better. We’ll have to make the river trail once a year
and buy the truck we need with the furs we can scrape together.
It’s that or quit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For some moments the man’s resentful eyes watched the
harnessing of a fresh buck. The creature bellowed and pawed the
ground with slashing, wide-spreading hoofs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We mak ’em, yes,” he said, as the beast quietened down. Then
he broke into a sudden fierce expletive. It was the savage temper
of the man as he thought of the cause of all their woes. “Tcha!”
he cried, and his white, strong teeth bared. “They kill your
father. They kill Pri-loo. Now they kill up all trade—dead. I go
all mad inside. I tak ’em in my two hand, an’—an’ I choke ’em dis
life out of ’em. I know. They mak it so we all die dead. No
pelts, no food, no deer. So we not wake up no more. Your
father—him live—plenty much gold. Oh, big plenty. Us rich. Us not
care for trade. Us buy ’em up all thing. Yes.” His dark eyes were
on the movements of the men with the deer. But he saw nothing.
Only the vision which his passionate heart conjured out of the
back cells of memory. “Bimeby,” he went on at last, in a tone
that was ominously quiet, “I mak one big trip. I go by the river
so I come by the big hills. Maybe I mak big trade that place.”
His eyes shone with a fierce smile. “Oh, yes, maybe. Then maybe I
come back. An’ when I come back then us break big trail an’ quit.
I know him dis trail. Great big plenty long trail. Us come by the
big river an’ the big lak’. The good boss, your father speak
plenty him name. M’Kenzie. Oh, yes. M’Kenzie River. Much heap
fur. All fur. Seal, bear, beaver, silver fox. Much, oh much.
Black fox, too. All him fur. Plenty Eskimo. Plenty trader mans.
Us not mak him Placer. Oh, no. Plenty whiteman by Placer. Him see
little Felice, white girl Kid, him steal him. Oh, yes. Usak know.
Him steal up all child, too. So. Missis Hesther, too. They mak
Felice to dance plenty an’ drink the fire water. Not so Hesther
woman. Him mak him work. All time work. Him old. Not so as
Felice. So I go by the trail. Bimeby I come back. Then us mak big
trail. Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>In spite of herself the Kid was interested. But her interest
was for that part of the man’s planning which related to the
mysterious journey which the Indian declared his intention of
taking. The talk of the McKenzie was by no means new to her. She
had heard it all before. It was the dream place of the Indian’s
mind, which the talk of her dead father had inspired. She shook
her head as her eyes followed the docile movements of the newly
broken buck.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why must you go up the river to the big hills?” she asked
seriously. “That’s new. The other isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man shrugged his angular shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I just go. An’ I come back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What for?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The blue eyes were searching the dark face narrowly. But the
man refused to be drawn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It plenty good place by the hills. Maybe I get fur.
Maybe—gold. I not know. Sometime I dream dis thing. I go by the
hills, an’ then I—come back. I know. Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl smiled, and the Indian responded for all his mood.
This girl was as the sun, moon, and stars of his life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, Usak,” she went on, with a little laugh, “maybe I guess
about this. You have a friend there by the hills. A woman eh?
That so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s eyes were sparkling as they grinned back into the
Kid’s face. But it was a different smile from that of the moment
before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I don’t figger I better ask any more,” the girl said
simply. “But we’re not going to the McKenzie. We’re not going to
quit here—yet. No. We’re going to make such trade as maybe at
Placer first. Later, if we figger it’s too worrying to make
Placer, then we’ll think of McKenzie, an’ you I guess’ll be free
to go right along an’ say good-bye to your lady friend up in the
hills. Let’s get this fixed right now. You guess this farm is
mine, my father started it for me. An’ you, big Indian that you
are, have done all you know to make it right for me. Well, I
guess it’s up to me to figger the thing I’m going to do. That’s
all right. I’ve figgered. So has our little mother. We’re goin’
to give this change two summers’ trial. And after that, if things
are still bad, why, we’ll think about—McKenzie.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid’s manner was decided. Usak was an Indian, a man of
extraordinary capacity and wonderful devotion. But from her
earliest days he had taught Felice that the farm was hers and he
was her servant. And the child had grown to feel and know her
authority, and the difference which colour made between them.
Whatever the man proposed, hers was the final decision. And for
all her real, deep regard for the man who had raised her, she
understood he was still her servant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now her decision was taken out of something that had no
relation to the welfare of those depending upon it. It had
nothing to do with the prosperity of the farm. It had nothing to
do with wisdom or judgment. It was inspired by one thing only.
The man whom she had passed up the rapids had said he would come
back. And she had told him to seek her ten miles up the Caribou
River. Two summers. Yes. He must surely be back in that time. If
not—well, perhaps, the McKenzie would be preferable to the Hekor
if he had not returned in that time.</p>

<p class='c010'>A shrill of childish voices broke upon the quiet of the sunlit
corral, and Usak turned as a troop of children came racing across
to where they were standing. Mary Justicia, by reason of her long
bare legs and superior age, led the way. And she was followed in
due sequence of ages by Clarence, Algernon, Percy, Gladys Anne,
and the rear was brought up by Jane Constance, a brownfaced,
curly-headed girl of about seven years. They were all
bare-legged, and the boys were scarcely clad at all above the
buckskin of their breeches. But they were full to the brim of
reckless animal spirits and the perfect health provided by a life
lived almost entirely in the open.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kid! Ho, Kid! Kid! Kid! Kid!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The name rang out in a chorus of summons ranging from the
rough, breaking voice of Clarence to the almost baby treble of
Jane Constance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid swung about as the youthful avalanche swept down upon
her, and, in a moment, she was almost smothered by the struggling
children reaching to get hold of some part of her clothing. There
could be no mistake. Adoration was shining in every eye as the
children reached her. There was laughter and a babel of voices as
they took possession of her and started to drag her towards the
house where dinner was waiting ready.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak looked on without a word. He was more than content. The
girl had given him her decision as to the future, and though it
clashed with his own ideas it was her decision, and, therefore,
would be obeyed. He was as nearly happy as his fierce, passionate
temper would permit. These children in their amazing hero worship
of their older sister, as they considered her, had his entire
approval. They were only little less to him than the Kid. He was
Indian and they were white. And the big heart of the man thrilled
at the thought that these helpless whites were no less his charge
than the grown woman-child of his “good boss.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>They were ranged about the rough table for their midday meal.
The step-ladder sequence of their ages and sizes was only broken
by the presence of the Kid, who sat at one end of it between
Algernon, of the red-head and freckles, and the grey-eyed Percy,
who was the born trader of the community. Hester McLeod, grey of
hair for all her comparative youth, smiling, small, and workworn
sat at the head of the table between the head and tail of her
reckless brood. Mary Justicia was at her right, a pretty,
black-haired angular girl of nearly fifteen, ready to minister to
everyone’s wants, a sort of telephonic communication with the
cookstove, and Jane Constance, with her mass of brown curls, and
a face more than splashed with the stew she was devouring, on her
left.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the moment they were all hungrily devouring, and silence,
only broken by sounds of mastication, prevailed. Each child had a
tin platter of venison stew to consume, and a beaker of hot tea
was set close to their hands. They fed themselves with spoons as
being the most convenient weapons, and attacked the fare, which
was more or less their daily menu, with an appetite that was
utterly unimpaired through monotony of diet.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid looked up from her food. For a moment her fond eyes
dwelt on the unkempt ragamuffins gathered about the table. There
was not one of the six that was without individual interest for
her. They often plagued her, but right down to the generally
incoherent Jane Constance they looked to her in everything, from
their games, to the needs of their growing bodies. She loved them
all for just what they were, unkempt, often up to their eyes in
dirt and mischief. But more than all she loved the patient,
mild-eyed woman at the head of the crazy table, whose purpose in
life seemed to be the whole and complete sacrifice of self.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her gaze wandered over the mud-plastered walls of the living
room of this Indian-built shanty. Every crack in it, every uneven
contour of the green logs of which it was constructed, was known
to her by heart. There were no decorations. There were no other
furnishings but the table, and the benches on which the children
sat for their food and lessons, and a makeshift cupboard in which
were stored groceries, and such domestic articles as Hesther had
been able to bring with her from the Fort. It was all crude. It
was all unlovely, except for the wealth of generous humanity it
sheltered. But every roughness it contained was bound up with
simple happiness for the girl, and the memory of long years of
childish delights.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’re going to give it two years’ trial, Mum,” she said,
while the children’s voices were held silent. “It’s the best we
can do, I guess, now old Ben’s pulled out. You’ll have to make
out the best you know while Usak and I beat down the river to
Placer once a year. Maybe it won’t be so bad for you now with
Clarence and Alg nearly grown men, and Mary fit to run the whole
bunch herself. If things don’t get worse, and we make good trade
in Placer I guess we’ll scratch along right here till the boys
are full grown. Then we’ll see the thing best to be done. If
things get worse Usak wants to make McKenzie River. He’s crazy
for the McKenzie Valley. With him it’s the thing to fix
everything right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mild-eyed mother reached out with a handful of apron and
wiped away the lavish helping of stew which had embedded itself
in Jane Constance’s thick brown curls. The smears on her chubby
face were hopeless. They could remain for the wash tub
afterwards.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess it’s what you say, Kid,” she acquiesced. “The good
God gave me two hands and the will to work. But I guess he forgot
about the means of guessin’ right when things got awry. The twins
are some men—now,” she went on fondly, gazing with pride upon
Clarence and Algernon, with his fiery red-head, the possession of
which was always a mystery to her contented mind. “We’ll make
out. Eh, Mary?” she cried, turning to the dark-eyed girl who was
her eldest child. “Things don’t figger to worry you if you don’t
worry them, I say. When do you pull out?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the breaking’s through, and the deer are ready for the
winter trail. The season’s good with us if we could only get the
pelts. We’ve more deer to trade than we’ve ever had before.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Percy looked up, his grey eyes alight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why don’t we quit trade and chase up that gold Usak’s always
yarning about,” he said eagerly. “It’s yours, Kid. Leastways it
was your paw’s. We wouldn’t need to worry with furs then.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy pushed his plate away. For all he was not yet twelve,
gold held a surpassing fascination for his alert, trading
mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m all for the gold, Mum,” he went on soberly. “An’ I’m real
glad old Ben’s gone. Ther’s no one around but ourselves now, when
we find it. Breeds don’t figger in it. When we get it we’ll
divide it all up. Kid’ll have most, ’cos it’s hers, anyway. The
one who finds it’ll have next. An’ Jane don’t need any. You see,
she’s a fool kid, an’ would maybe try to eat it. Guess I’m goin’
to find it.” The Kid laughed, and exchanged meaning glances with
the mother across the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you beat him?” she cried, and all the children laughed
with her. “He’s arranged for the finder to have next most to me.
Say Perse, Mum had best read you out of the Testament. Ther’s a
man in it they used to call Judas. I guess you ought to know
about him. Ther’s another feller, but I don’t know about him. He
was in another book. He was the same sort of feller only not so
bad. I think they called him Shylock. He’s in one of old Ben
Needham’s books, so you can’t read about him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t want to anyway,” retorted the unabashed Perse. “Soon as
I’m as big as Clarence an’ Red-head I’m goin’ out after that
gold, an’ I’ll buy you all a swell ranch an’ fixings, an’ give
you all you want, an’ Mum won’t have to work no more. I reckon
Clarence an’ Red-head are kites. Wish I was big as them.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kite’s nothin’!” Clarence was without humour, and took his
small brother seriously. “You’ll do the chores same as us when
you’re big as us. Ther’ ain’t no gold ’cept in Usak’s head. Mum
said the Euralians got it years back. You’d do a heap better
gettin’ after pelts same as us—only we can’t get ’em.
Gold—nothin’!” Perse thrust his empty plate towards Mary Justicia
who took it for replenishment, and he watched while his mother
wrung the small nose of Jane Constance which had got mixed up
with her stew.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When I’m growed I won’t do a thing I can’t do,” he observed
graphically. “If ther’ ain’t pelts wot’s the use chasin’ ’em? You
can’t say ther’ ain’t gold till you chased it. I’m goin’ to chase
that gold,” he finished up stubbornly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, it doesn’t matter anyway what any of you are going to
do in the future,” the Kid said with finality. “Just now we’re
kind of up against it, and you’ve all got to help Mum all you
know. Isn’t that so, Mum?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther beamed mildly round on the children, not one of whom
she would have been without for all the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess that’s so,” she said. “We’re all goin’ to do our
best, sure. That’s what God set us to do. You see, kids, the folk
who do the best that’s in ’em mostly get the best of life. An’
the best of life don’t always mean a heap of gold, an’ not even a
heap of pelts. It mostly means a happy heart, an’ a healthy body.
And when you die it ain’t no more uncomfortable or worrying than
goin’ to sleep when you’re tired, same as you do most every night
when the flies an’ skitters’ll let you. Now if you’re all through
we’ll clean up. You boys see an’ pass Mary Justicia the chattels,
an’ fix ’em dry after she’s swabbed ’em clean, while I huyk Jane
Constance from under the stew that’s missed her mouth. I guess
Gladys Anne needs fixing some that way, too. Perse, you get me a
bucket o’ water an’ a swab. Maybe I won’t need soap—we ain’t got
none to spare.”</p>

    <div>WITHIN THE CIRCLE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bill Wilder was squatting on a boulder under cover
of the stone-built fortifications. His rifle was lying in an
emplacement overlooking the waterway below. His grey eyes were
pre-occupied, searching the red, sandy foreshore across the
river, which rose gently, baldly, sloping steadily upwards to the
boulder-strewn, serrated skyline beyond.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot was seated near by. His rifle lay in another
emplacement ready for immediate use. He was chewing in the
thoughtful fashion habitual to him, even under the greatest
stress. He, too, was searching the far side of the river. His
gaze was no less intent. It was the look of a man whose habit has
become that of ceaseless watchfulness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I wish I hadn’t let him go now.” Wilder spoke without
turning. It was almost as though he were thinking aloud. “He’s a
crazy sort of hot-head who can’t sit around when ther’s a scrap
to be had.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot spat through the loophole with great exactness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t need to worry for Mike,” he said, with a short
laugh that was not intended as an expression of mirth. “He’ll get
along when he’s through. Ther’ ain’t the darn Euralian born that
could chew him up. He’s spent the worst part of a rotten bad life
doin’ his best to lose it by every fool play Placer could offer
him—an’ failed. I guess a wild-cat’s a poor sort of circumstance
in the matter of lives alongside Mike. I don’t worry a
thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The break in their silence closed up at once. Chilcoot took a
fresh chew and wiped the mosquitoes from the back of his neck.
Wilder filled his pipe. The smell of cooking was in the air.
There were others lining the fortifications at every point, and
one or two men were moving about the camp fire behind them. But
for all the watch at the outer walls the place suggested noonday
idleness. Even the trail dogs were drowsing in the shade of the
walls.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Arctic sun shone down out of a cloud-flecked sky on a
scene of barren unloveliness. Long since it had burned up such
meagre foliage as the floods of spring had made possible. The
whole country-side was as bald as an African sand desert. The
blaze of miniature spring flowers had been swept away, and the
dried grass was as brown and wiry as the sparse bristles on the
back of some hoary hog. Even the lichens which flourished on the
low, rock formations of which the whole country of this northern
river was composed, were in little better case. Utter sterility
lay in every direction. The desolation, the heat, the flies, the
mosquitoes, these things made for a condition that was well nigh
intolerable.</p>

<p class='c010'>The camp was set at the far headwaters of Loon Creek. It was
nominally a gold camp; in reality it had little to do with
anything but defence. It was a veritable fortress built out of
the millions of storm-worn boulders that littered the region. A
wide, encompassing stone corral, nearly ten feet high, formed the
outer defence, which, in turn, contained a stout, similarly built
citadel which sheltered quarters for men and dogs, and the stores
and gear of the outfit.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder and his men had embarked on their expedition with
no greater concern than had usually been the case when the magic
of gold had been the sole lure. George Raymes had despatched him
to these uncharted regions with a curiosity deeply stirred, but
with the gold fever burning fiercely in his veins. And Wilder had
prepared for every emergency, but always with a smile of
deprecation for the extent of the war-like stores which the
police officer insisted were absolutely necessary. Now he was
more than thankful for the foresight of the man who had some
twenty-five years of police experience behind him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was under no illusion now after a year of this deplorable
territory. None of the men with him had any illusion either. The
lure of gold may have been the original inspiration with them,
but from the moment of embarking upon the waters of Loon Creek it
had been swept from their minds in the fight for their very
existence that was swiftly forced upon them. For all they only
contemplated the pursuit of a legitimate calling in their own
Canadian territory they found themselves cut off by many hundreds
of miles from all help in a country peopled by a race of beings
who were furiously hostile.</p>

<p class='c010'>All through the previous summer the war had been waged. It had
been a heart-breaking guerilla warfare that knew no cessation.
The mysterious enemy seemed to be waiting for them at every
possible point along the river, and in each and every case the
resulting fight was of that comparatively long range character
that was more irritating than disastrous.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Euralians were past masters in the art of challenging
Wilder’s progress. They never offered a pitched battle. They
attacked at a distance with rifle and soft-nosed bullet, and the
pin-pricking of it was like the maddening attacks of the swarming
mosquitoes. The whole thing was amazingly well-calculated. There
was no respite, there was not a moment in which the creek could
be adequately explored for gold. The expedition was forced to
defence almost every hour of the unending daylight.</p>

<p class='c010'>In this fashion, during the first summer, the headwaters of
the creek had been reached. But they had been reached with barely
time to build winter quarters before the freeze up and the long
night of winter descended upon the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the closing in of the Arctic night hostilities ceased as
far as the human enemy was concerned. The Euralians fled before
the overwhelming forces which Nature was about to turn loose.
Perhaps they understood the terror which the intruders would be
forced to endure on these barren lands where shelter was unknown.
Perhaps they considered it sufficient. Perhaps they feared for
themselves the ferocity of the Arctic night. Doubtless they were
simply satisfied that their prey was held fast, a helpless
prisoner within the walls of the stronghold he had set up in
defence, and was powerless to operate in any of the desired
directions. At any rate Wilder was left unmolested in the grip of
the northern man’s natural enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>It had been a desperate time in which the intensity of cold
was the least of many hardships. Fuel had been scarce enough, but
sufficient driftwood and masses of dried lichen had been
collected to make life possible. So the expedition had endured
through alternating periods of snow-storm and blizzard, when the
blackness of the northern night could well-nigh be felt. Then had
come those brilliant intervals of starlight when the twilight
grew under the splendour of a blazing aurora, and the temperature
dropped, dropped till the depths of cold seemed illimitable.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was in these extremities that the whiteman displayed his
right to his position in the scheme of life. An iron discipline
ruled the camp, and never for a moment was it relaxed. Never was
the mind permitted to drift from the appointed labours. Storm or
calm it was the same. For Bill Wilder, and Chilcoot, and even the
hot-head, Red Mike knew that it was work, or the complete
disintegration of the will to endure, which, in turn, would mean
disruption and final disaster to the whole of their outfit.</p>

<p class='c010'>So desperate was the interminable winter that every man of the
outfit welcomed the deluge of spring with its promptly swarming
flies and mosquitoes, and the reopening of hostilities with their
almost unseen human enemy. Within a month summer was upon them,
and the previous summer’s battle was again in full swing. So it
had gone on. And now at last the wear and futility of it all was
beginning to have its effect. The expedition had endured for a
year under conditions almost unendurable. And during the whole of
that period not one single detail of its original purpose had
been achieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gold? It was the last thing in their thoughts now. And as for
the Euralians, with whom they had been in fighting contact for at
least half the time, their identity, their personality was the
same sealed book to Wilder that it had been before he had
listened to their story from the lips of George Raymes. They had
never yet made one single prisoner, or possessed themselves of
the slain body of a single victim of their rifles. No member of
the outfit had as yet more than a rifle shot view of these
savages, who so skilfully avoided contact while yet prosecuting
their warfare.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot regarded his leader and friend with eyes that
twinkled for all they were serious.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. Not for him,” he said provocatively.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder lit his pipe. Then he reached out and opened the breech
of his rifle to let the air pass through the fouled barrel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess that’s a qualification,” he said regarding the weapon
in his hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure,” Chilcoot again laughed shortly. “Ther’s bigger things
to worry for than Red Mike—crazy as he is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded. He laid his rifle back in its place with the
breech closed, and a fresh clip of cartridges in its
magazine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boys are worrying, an’ it ain’t good. Buck Maberley told
me a bunch of stuff,” the other went on. “But it ain’t the
trouble they’re liable to make. We ken fix that sort o’ junk
easy—up here. No. They’ve a reas’nable grouch though. For once
their fool brains are leaking something better than Placer hooch.
I guess they’re askin’ each other the questions you an’ me have
been askin’ ourselves without makin’ a shout of it. And they’re
mostly finding the same answer we get. They’re guessing if we lie
around here about another month, makin’ target practice for them
crazy foreign Injuns we look like takin’ a big chance of never
hitting up against Placer hooch ever again. Which is only another
way o’ sayin’ winter’ll fall on us before we can get back on to
the Hekor, an’ if we’ve the grub we ain’t got the guts to see it
through. You see, it would be kind o’ diff’rent if we’d the
colour of gold to sort of cheer us up. But what spare time those
blamed Injuns leave the boys they spend in panning river dirt for
the stuff it never heard about since ever the world began. An’
they’re sick to death makin’ fools of their better judgment.
Curse the skitters.” Again Chilcoot brushed his hand across his
blistered neck and wiped its palm on his moleskin trouser
leg.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded as he, too, strove to rid himself of the insect
attacks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll have to beat it,” he said with a sigh of regret, but
with decision. “I hate quitting,” he went on a little gloomily.
“I wouldn’t say you’re right, boy, ther’s no gold on this river.
But we can’t get after it right. If the stuff right down here on
the river in front of us ain’t pay dirt I’m all sorts of a
sucker. But it don’t matter. These cursed Euralians have got us
dead set so we can’t shake a pan right. We’re beat. Plumb beat.
They got us worried and guessing, which in a territory like this,
means—finished. Man, I’m sick to death of the bald hummocks and
the flies. Another winter up here would get me yeppin’ around
like a crazy coyote.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot had turned back to his watch on the river. “Yep,” he
agreed, relieved at his chief’s swift decision. “When’ll we pull
out?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right after Red Mike gets back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The men continued their vigil in silence for awhile. The
contemplation of retreat, the acknowledgment of defeat were
things that affected them deeply. Both were of a keen fighting
disposition. But their inclinations were coldly tempered by the
experience and wisdom which in earlier days must have been
impossible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, boy,” Wilder went on presently, in the
contemplative fashion of a mind groping, “these Indians have got
me guessing harder than I’ve ever guessed in my life. It’s up to
us handing a report to old Raymes when we get along down. Well, I
guess if I was to pass him haf the stuff jangling around in my
head, I’d be liable to get a laugh from our <em>superior</em>
that ’ud make me want to commit murder. These darn neches are
fighting like Prussian Junkers. They’re armed like Bolsheviks.
And they’re using the soft-nosed slugs you’d reckon to find in
the hands of modern Communists. Here they are thousands of miles
beyond the reach of the folk who could hand ’em that stuff. Yet
they’ve got it plenty, and know every darn move in the game
played by European armies. Say, it wouldn’t stagger me to find
our fort doused with poison gas.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot spat with unnecessary vigour.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re guessin’ ther’s something white behind ’em?” he said
sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“White?” Wilder laughed. He shook his head. “Maybe though,” he
said, “the thing that would best please me just now would be for
that darnation Irishman to bring us in a prisoner. Say, has it
hit you we’ve never got a close sight of these folks. Have you
discovered that looking at results it looks like we’ve never
killed one blamed rascal of ’em, and yet we reckon to carry with
us some of the best artists with a rifle this darned country
possesses. We’ve had hundreds of brownfaced targets for ’em, too.
What does it mean? Why just this. Dead or alive these neches
don’t mean us to get a close view of their men. They’re afraid
for a whiteman to—recognise them. Well?” He laughed again. “Say,
ther’s a big play behind this thing, and we haven’t begun to
discover it. I’m not through with it. But I’m going to beat it
down to the Hekor right away, and get a look into it from another
angle. Raymes was right. It looks to me as if the feller who
solves the riddle of these—Euralians—is doing something mighty
good for a whiteman’s country. The gold’s quit worrying me a
little bit. Say—”</p>

<p class='c010'>He broke off and gazed musingly over the glittering waters of
the river, which was visible for miles away to the north in the
flat, barren country through which it meandered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot waited. His friend’s unusual burst of confidence was
not a thing he desired to interrupt. Besides he had voiced much
of the thing that had disturbed his less sensitive mind. So he
went on chewing with his eyes glued to the opposite shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, boy, we’d have done well to have kept touch with
that dandy Kid we found at the mouth of the Caribou,” Wilder
continued. “I’ve the notion that bright girl was wiser to the
things up this way than that factor feller. An’ certainly wiser
than George Raymes. She said she was born an’ raised on the
river. I wonder. I guess I’ve been wondering ever since. You know
there’s more to this play of ours than gold, an’ Euralians an’
things. There’s a ‘girl child—white.’ You remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot’s eyes were grinning into the other’s face as Wilder
broke off. He nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure I do. She’s surely a dandy Kid,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>His grin passed, and seriousness replaced it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But she’d got six brothers an’ sisters an’ a mother, an’ I
don’t remember that Raymes said a word about them. You were
feelin’ particular not to ast questions of her. Well, I guess it
was a pity. Ben Needham never passed us a hint of her, either.
Say, this is the queerest darn country. It hides up a whole heap
of queer things. Guess it’s that gets hold of us mutts who waste
precious years trying to beat it. We can locate that Kid passing
down river, though. An’ maybe you’ll feel less a’mighty delicate
astin’ questions.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. I fixed to do that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guessed so. I—Say, ther’s Mike beating it for home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot stood up as he spoke and leant over the hot stone
parapet. He was searching the canoe which had suddenly appeared
driving down the sluggish stream from the north.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder, too, had risen to his feet. He was looking for the
desired prisoner in the boat. He counted the occupants. There
were four. Only four. And that was the number the Irishman had
set out with. No. There was no prisoner. The men in the boat were
all whitemen. There could be no doubt about it. Nor was there any
sign of a wounded man lying in the bottom of the little
craft.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The same old story,” Wilder grumbled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Meaning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They’re coming back empty—Gee!”</p>

<p class='c010'>A shot rang out. It was followed by another and another. The
men at the fort saw the water splash about the canoe where the
bullets took effect. But the boat came on through the sudden
hail, and the men at the paddles remained unscathed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s Indian shooting,” Chilcoot exclaimed contemptuously.
Then in a tone of deep regret. “If those guys would only give our
boys such a target.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so.” Bill stood with his rifle ready, waiting for a
sign of the lurking enemy. “That boat would never make the bank
if it was full of Euralians. It makes you think they aren’t
yearning to kill. Only to worry. Come on. Let’s go down and get
Mike’s news.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s outfit was lying moored and camped at the mouth of
Loon Creek where its waters debouched on the broad course of the
Hekor. The barrens were left far behind, and these men had come
again to a country where shade from the blistering sunlight was
to be found in occasional bluffs of forest, and where there was
complete rest from the curiously unnerving warfare they had so
long endured.</p>

<p class='c010'>The camp was pitched on a great spit of land supporting a
dwarfed, windswept bluff of forest trees. The shade from the
burning sun was more than welcome for all the haunting mosquitoes
made it their camping ground too. Great smudge fires of dank
vegetation and lichen had been lit, and, for the moment, even
insect hostilities had ceased. The canoes had been safely stowed
for the night, and the men sat around in the drifting smoke after
their supper, while the trail dogs prowled in search of any
refuse which the meal of their human masters provided.</p>

<p class='c010'>For all it was night, and rest and sleep lay ahead, the sun
had only changed its position in the sky and daylight was
unabated. It might have been high noon from the unshadowed
brilliance of the world about them. As Red Mike had once said in
his graphic complaining: “God A’mighty created the summer sun,
but the Divil set it afire to burn everlastin’ north of 60
degrees.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The three leaders were squatting on their outspread blankets
in the shade cast by a small clump of storm-driven spruce. They
were luxuriating in the smoke of three smudge fires set
triangularly about them. Each was clad as lightly as
circumstances would permit. Cotton shirts and hard moleskin
trousers belted about their waists was all and more than
sufficient. Their arms and chests were bare. Each man was smoking
a reeking pipe, and a curiously fascinating, somnolent atmosphere
prevailed over the camp. It was the quiet of physical repose
after heavy labour, intensified by the Nature sounds which are
never absent in the northern wilderness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Red Mike chuckled in his irrepressible fashion, and Wilder and
Chilcoot turned their reflective eyes inquiringly on his grinning
countenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, it’s a night—if you can call it night with hell’s own
sun burning blisters on the water—for rejoicin’,” he said. “Is it
a drop o’ the stuff you’re goin’ to open, Bill Wilder? Or has the
water wagon got you still tied to its tail? Man, I could drink
the worst home-brew ever came out of a prohibition State.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder hunched himself up with his hands locked about his
knees, and a faint smile of derision lit his steady eyes.
“Rejoicing?” he said. “I don’t get you, Mike.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman’s blue eyes widened good-humouredly. “Ther’s
folks never made to rec’nize the time for rejoicin’, ’less it’s
set for ’em by politician-made law. It seems to me I remember the
time when Bill Wilder didn’t need the other feller to learn him
that way. Say, we come down that mud-bottomed creek nigh
two-hundred an’ fifty mile without a shot fired. From the moment
we broke that crazy camp we set up to hold our place on the map
of this fool country them Euralians quit us cold. Guess they
said, ‘The gophers are on the run, let ’em beat it. They’re
quittin’, an’ we ain’t got time worritin’ with quitters.’ So they
handed us an elegant sort o’ Sunday School picnic passin’ down
stream, makin’ twenty-five a day without puttin’ the weight of a
fly on the paddles. Well? Ain’t it time fer rejoicin’? Here we
are right back in a territory that looks almost good to me after
those blazin’ barrens we left behind. We’re right back with whole
skins by courtesy of a bunch of dirty neches.” He laughed again.
“It’s sure time to—celebrate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Chilcoot who replied to him. And his retort came in the
sharp tones of a man unable to appreciate the raillery of the
Irishman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We ain’t quittin’ them neches,” he said, his deep-set eyes
snapping. “Guess our work’s only started. But you’re right. It’s
time to rejoice <em>when we quit</em>, which won’t be this side
of winter. If you’d hoss sense you’d know we’re out-fitted
for—three years. Guess Bill here ain’t openin’ any old corks till
we’re through.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mike sobered on the instant. He turned to Wilder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What comes next, boss?” he asked shortly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded his head towards the great hills in the
west.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Hekor, Mike,” he said seriously. “Ther’s no home run yet.
There’s nearly four months to the freeze up, an’ we pull out of
here, west, after we’ve slept. We’re making west to the
headwaters, an’ to get a look at the hill country. Ther’s gold
around somewhere, and there are those neches—as you choose to
call ’em. We aren’t ‘quitting’ till we know more about both.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>It was a scene which years before other eyes had gazed upon.
It was the canyon of the Grand Falls where the Hekor fell off the
highlands of the Alaskan hills. Wilder and his men were ashore at
the only landing available, and again it was a landing which had
been used by another years before.</p>

<p class='c010'>The gold man and his fellows were fascinated by the tremendous
grandeur of the canyon, with the dull roar of great waters coming
back to them out of the dense clouds of spray which enveloped the
far distance of the straight hewn rift down which the surge of
dark waters rushed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can’t make that stuff,” Chilcoot demurred, his eyes on the
turbulent race of water which the canyon disgorged.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We aren’t going to attempt it.” Wilder shrugged. He turned to
Mike who stood gazing out into the far distance absorbed by the
magnificence which so deeply appealed to his Gallic
imagination.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We got to see the thing lying back of those Falls,” he said
pointing. “Will you make it, Mike? Will you make it with Chilcoot
and me? We can leave camp to Buck Maberley. He can handle the
boys good, and you can put it up to him. I guess it means a
portage up there. Then—Well, who knows? Maybe we’ll be back here
in two weeks. Maybe two months. I’ve got a notion, and I’ve got
to put it through. That territory out there is Alaskan, and I
want to get a look. Are you falling for it? I want the answer
right now. I’m guessing all the time. I don’t know a thing. But
I’ve got to get a look back of those Falls. Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mike’s gaze remained on the distance. The fascination of it
refused to release him. He replied without turning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure boss,” he said simply. Then he added whimsically “I’ll
fall for water—like that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Chilcoot laughed. Even he found the frank admission of the
red-headed creature’s weakness irresistible.</p>

    <div>THE HOUSE IN THE VALLEY OF THE FIRE HILLS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Squat, broad, watchful Chilcoot Massy was standing
on a crazy, log-built landing which the years had rotted and clad
with dank mosses and leathery fungus. His deep-set eyes were full
of wondering curiosity. For the moment his work was standing
guard over the canoe which was moored to the landing, and which
was the only means by which he and his companions could hope to
return in safety to Buck Maberley and the rest of the outfit
encamped three weeks’ journey away below the Falls of the Hekor
River.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder and Red Mike had been away a full hour or more.
They had gone to search the woods which came down almost to the
water’s edge. They had gone to reconnoitre the crowning discovery
which the search behind the Falls had yielded them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot had spent his time usefully. With his friends’ going
he had turned his attention first to the human signs about him.
They had not been many, but they had been such as he could read
out of his wide experience. The rusted mooring rings on the
landing told of comparatively recent use. The moss and fungus had
been trodden by other feet than his own and those of his
companions. Then, on the bank, there were the ashes of camp
fires, and a certain amount of litter which camping never fails
to leave behind it. There was no doubt in his mind. For all the
landing was more or less derelict, it was still a place of call
for those who used this hidden waterway.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot regretted not one moment of the labours of the past
three weeks. The portage up the canyon of the Falls of the Hekor
River had been gruelling. But compensation had awaited them. The
grandeur of the scene, the immensity of the Falls had been
something overwhelming. He had seen nothing comparable with
either. Then had come the journey up the wide river above them,
and ultimately the lake supported high up in a cup formed by the
snow-clad hills. He had felt, if no other purpose had been
achieved, the wonders of this rugged hill country were amply
worth while. But the ultimate discovery of the hidden channel,
debouching into the lake through a narrow, twisted canyon cut
through the walls of the surrounding hills, which had brought
them to the strange, super-heated, mysterious Valley of the Fire
Hills, had changed his entire estimate of the reckless journey
upon which Wilder had embarked. Out of his long experience of the
northern world he realised that here was a discovery of real
importance.</p>

<p class='c010'>First it had been the curious black sand bed, over which the
sluggish, oily waters of the creek flowed, that had caught and
riveted his attention. Then had come the black slopes of the
three smoking hills. But, at last, when they reached the human
construction of the lumber-built landing, and glimpsed the lofty
watch tower, erected within the heart of the woods just inland of
it, he realised something of the real meaning of the thing they
had chanced upon. There was nothing of Indian or Eskimo about the
landing. No watch tower such as they had sighted above the
tree-tops owed its origin to savage ideas of defence or
construction. No. Here was habitation deeply hidden with more
than native cunning. Here was something which pointed, in
conjunction with the curious features of the creek, to whiteman
enterprise of some serious commercial value. So, in an atmosphere
of suffocating humidity, he was waiting, keeping guard upon the
canoe, lest, as in the past, they were to find themselves again
in hostile territory.</p>

<p class='c010'>Having explored the signs about him he remained gazing down
upon the black sand bordering the sluggish waters, and thought
and speculation ran on while he searched as far as he could see
up and down the creek. Was he dreaming? Was it all fancy? Would
he waken presently to the rock-littered country of the “barrens”
on Loon Creek?</p>

<p class='c010'>No. He gazed out at the distant smoke cloud overhanging the
valley, and shook his head in answer to his unvoiced questions.
No. There was no fancy to any of it. It was real. Amazingly real.
The valley was no magic, but a substantial reality of Nature.</p>

<p class='c010'>Memory was stirring. Other scenes and other times had come
back to him. He remembered his early days on the McKenzie. He
remembered the tar-sands which were common enough along its
almost illimitable course. He remembered the queer of it. How the
precious liquid tar oozed up through the sand and settled into
great pools. He remembered the curious jets of gas which spouted
through the sand, and how they used to set fire to them, and cook
by the flame, and heat the tar with which they smeared the
bottoms of their light kyaks. He remembered how the Indians and
Breeds did the same thing, and had done so throughout the
centuries. The thing which chance had now found for them was
something of the same. Here was a valley whose heart was flooded
with coal tar and oil. Oil? To judge by the signs all down the
length of the valley they had so far traversed, there should be
supplies of oil sufficient for the world’s needs for years. The
secret of the habitation which his comrades had gone to
reconnoitre was no longer a secret in his estimation. Somewhere
along this creek must be commercial workings of the precious
material with which he judged the region to be flooded. Who? Who?
His mind groped along every channel for an explanation. Whiteman?
Perhaps. Euralian? He left his final question without an
answer.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>“’St!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mike laid a detaining hand on the arm of Wilder. They were
moving cautiously through the woods skirting the clearing in
which the great, sprawling, log-built house stood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder had halted in response to the Irishman’s gesture, and
whispered back his inquiry with some impatience.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Someone behind us.” The eyes of the other were searching
amongst the trees and undergrowth through which they had just
passed. “Guess the bush broke twice. It’s no sort of fancy.
Ther’s someone—”</p>

<p class='c010'>He broke off listening, and Wilder distinctly recognised the
faint snapping of brushwood somewhere away in rear of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>They waited. But as no further sound was forthcoming Wilder
shrugged his shoulders and nodded in the direction of the
clearing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess we can’t worry with that,” he said, his eyes regarding
the pile of buildings upon which the sunlight was pouring.
“There’s not a soul around that house anyway, so far as I can
see. Guess there isn’t even a cur dog. We best quit this wood,
and make a break for it. We got to know who lives there. And it
don’t much matter how they take our visit. You got your guns
fixed right?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman chuckled in his light-hearted fashion. The
invasion of the house appealed to his reckless spirit. His
fighting temper made him hope, and his hope found swift
expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll be sick to death if it’s white folk,” he said. “I’m
yearning to hit up against some of the Euralian gang. Come right
on, boss. I’m your man if you’re goin’ to break in on ’em. My
guns are sure fixed.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Their guns were utterly unneeded. As Wilder had surmised the
place was completely deserted. Their intrusion had passed
unchallenged by any living thing from the moment of entering the
clearing. Now at last, having passed through a seemingly endless
series of rooms and passages, they found themselves standing in a
great central hall, beautiful in its simple display of rich
oriental decorations.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman’s blue eyes were grinning as they surveyed the
deserted splendour with which he was surrounded. He was incapable
of appreciating the full significance of that upon which he
gazed. He had been robbed of a forcible encounter, but he found
some sort of compensation in the astounding thing they had
discovered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gee!” he cried. “Makes you feel you’ve quit the dam old north
country, an’ hit up against some buzzy-headed Turk’s harem. Say,
get a peek at them di-vans. An’ them curtain things. An’ them
junk china pots. Holy—!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He broke off and his grinning eyes sobered. A thought had
flashed through his impulsive brain and held him silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder was regarding him. All that Mike had only just sensed
he had realised from the moment they had set foot in the house.
The place was a miniature palace, something decaying, but the
whole interior told of Eastern tastes, Eastern habits, Eastern
life. The place had been furnished for oriental occupation. And
realising this the name of one race alone had flashed into his
mind. Japanese!</p>

<p class='c010'>A surge of excitement stirred. He gazed about the great hall,
with its silken hangings, heavily encumbered with the dust of
years, with its low silken couches. Then the carved wooden
screen, and the central fireplace elaborately built under its
smoke funnel. He glanced at the bureau bookcase of modern
fashioning, and with every detail added conviction came to
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>But desertion, or at least neglect, was stamped everywhere.
There was dust on everything. There was a curious musty smell
which could not be mistaken. But, somehow, for all that, there
were signs, unmistakable signs that desertion was not absolute.
There had been remains of food in the pantries. There were ashes
in the cookstoves in the kitchen. There was <em>water</em> in
various pitchers and buckets. No. Utter neglect, but not complete
desertion. This was Wilder’s final verdict, gaining corroboration
as he remembered the sounds of breaking bush which Red Mike’s
ears had been so swift to detect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We best make the sleeping quarters, Mike,” Wilder said after
awhile. “They’re liable to tell us the last thing we need to
know.” And he passed round the room in search of an outlet which
might lead to the apartments above.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Wilder flung the curtains quickly aside. It was an arched
entrance to one of the upper rooms. He stepped within the room
closely followed by Mike, and they stood silently regarding the
interior with appraising eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Here again there was no occupant. It was a bedroom, and,
judging by its proportions, the principal bedroom. As it had been
in the hall below the furnishings were largely of Eastern
fashion. But a modern, Western bedstead occupied the central
place, and a bureau dressing-chest stood near to a window. For
the rest there were silken curtains of lavish wistaria and
chrysanthemum design hanging at the windows, and the floor of
yellow pine was covered with Eastern, tufted rugs.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the furnishings and decorations of this far hidden home no
longer pre-occupied Wilder. He had discovered the thing he wanted
in the modern bed and the faint, rather noxious odour which human
occupation leaves behind it for senses sufficiently acute. The
bed was unmade. It was in the condition left by a person who has
just arisen from it. But he also realised that not one but two
persons had been its last occupants. This in itself was
illuminating, but not nearly so enlightening as the prevailing
odour of the room. That curious human odour had been instantly
recognised. And Wilder knew it had no relation to beings of his
own race. Again the name of the sons of Nippon flashed through
his mind, and a deep satisfaction warmed him as he remembered
that after all it looked as though he would not have to return
entirely empty-handed to his friend, George Raymes.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned sharply to his companion who had lost interest under
his chief’s silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess I’ve seen all I need,” he said, while his eyes
continued to regard the bedstead. “We’ll get right back to the
landing.” He thrust back his cap from his broad forehead and
turned towards the window which looked out to the south. “Yes,
we’ll get right back. This darn place is not deserted. There are
folks around. That being so there’s just one thing worrying. It’s
the safety of our canoe, and our outfit. So we’ll get along, and
you and Chilcoot will have to share guard on the outfit between
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mike’s blue eyes lit. The thing his chief suggested restored
hope to his fighting spirit.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If ther’s folk around—an’ I guess you’re right—we’re liable
to— Say, what’s your play, boss, with us two standin’ by the
outfit?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s gaze came back from the window. He had only looked
out upon what seemed to be unbroken forest. He shrugged. And a
half smile lit his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, I’m goin’ to eat first,” he said. “After that—why, after
that I’m goin’ to take up a considerable temporary abode in this
shanty.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Alone?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A look of concern had gathered in the Irishman’s expressive
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But—Say—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here. Listen, Mike,” Wilder exclaimed a little impatiently.
“That goes. You understand. I’m going to sleep one night at least
under this roof. And I’ve got to do it alone. Ther’s folks
belonging to this place, and they’re around. If I’ve the sense of
a blind mule I reckon they’ll sure come back to their camp. Well,
that’s what I want. And I want ’em to find me here first. Come
on. Let’s go an’ eat, an’ see how Chilcoot’s making out.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The quiet of the place was intense. Not a sound of any sort
penetrated the thick log walls of the house in the clearing. The
brilliant, interminable daylight went on, for all the hour
belonged to night. No ripple of air served to temper the humid
heat of the valley outside. And within the house the feeling of
suffocation was well-nigh intolerable.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder had flung himself into the upholstered chair which
stood before the bureau bookcase which stood in the central
apartment. It was midnight, and he was completely weary of his
solitary wanderings through the deserted house. He had searched
in every direction, in every outhouse, and every nook and corner
of the great building. For something like four hours he had
continued his work from the summit of the look-out tower to the
empty, filthy dog corrals on the fringe of the clearing. And all
his labours had yielded him nothing beyond that which the place
had told him in the first few minutes of his earlier visit with
Red Mike. He was disappointed. He was tired. But somehow he felt
that, for all the negative result he had obtained so far, there
was something still to come. Something which would ultimately
reward his persistence.</p>

<p class='c010'>He felt his early inspiration was not for nothing. He knew it
was not. A subtle conviction pursued him, had pursued him every
minute of his lonely search. He could not have explained his
reasons for the belief that obsessed him. There were no tangible
grounds for it, but he knew, he felt that from the moment he had
set foot within the strange house there had been eyes following
his every movement, there was someone, who, all unseen, had never
for a single moment permitted him to pursue his investigations
unobserved.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was by no means imaginative in the ordinary way. His nerves
were like highly tempered steel. He had no fear of any sort
either physical or superstitious. He had no thought of any
ghostly presence. But he knew instinctively that someone
belonging to that place was moving through it with him, but along
ways, and possibly hidden passages, which he had been unable to
discover.</p>

<p class='c010'>His automatic pistol was fully loaded, and, from the first
moment of his vigil, he had been reasonably prepared for any
eventuality, but he knew, his hard common sense told him, that if
his belief was justified there was not one single instant as he
plodded his way through apartment after apartment, or even while
sitting in the chair at the desk with his back turned on the rest
of the great hall, that he was not at the complete mercy of those
who were observing his movements.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now he prepared for the last act of his search. That completed
he would carry out the rest of his simple programme. Yes, he must
search the desk, and the book shelves above it. Then he would
betake himself to the great bedroom upstairs and occupy the bed
which he knew had recently been occupied by others. A grim smile
hovered for a moment in his steady eyes as he thought of the
outrage this taking of the bed of another constituted in his
understanding of the decencies of life. Maybe it would— He
dismissed the thought from his mind, and, reaching out, lowered
the flap front of the desk.</p>

<p class='c010'>But he did not commence the search of the array of drawers and
pigeon-holes laden with documents with which the interior was
furnished. Instead, he sat back in the capacious chair regarding
the rich inlay of mother-of-pearl, and the exquisite carving
which was revealed. The beauty of the workmanship of the desk
made only a passing impression. It was not admiration that left
him idly contemplating the thing before him. It was something
else. Something all unexpected and uncalculated. Quite suddenly a
wave of reluctance, that was closely akin to sheer repugnance,
had taken hold of him, and denied him the completion of the work
he had set his hand to. For the life of him he could not pry into
the private papers of his unknown host. Japanese, or any other,
it made no difference. That sort of thing was sheer police work,
and, for all he had been sworn a special constable for the
occasion by his friend, George Raymes, the police spirit had not
yet fully taken possession of his civilian feelings. No. He shut
the desk up with something of the rough force which his
self-disgust inspired. He shot back the supporting arms into
their sockets, and turned his chair about in a manner which
displayed his irrevocable decision.</p>

<p class='c010'>So he sat back, and drew his pipe from his pocket and filled
it contemplatively. His eyes were half smiling, and his
expression was wholly ironical for what he regarded as his own
contemptible weakness.</p>

<p class='c010'>He lit his pipe and gazed about him over the apartment. It was
well past midnight now, and the broad light of day lit the place
with a soft evenness that was something monotonous. And, smoking,
he permitted his thoughts to pursue the trend which his position
inspired.</p>

<p class='c010'>Strangely enough they left him without a shadow of concern for
himself, and only sought to unravel the mystery with which he
knew he was surrounded.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was in the heart of the hills whence the Euralians were
reputed to hail from. He had discovered a miniature palace, not a
rough shanty, and it was furnished with the taste, and for the
abode of someone of unquestionably Japanese origin. A certainty
existed in his mind that the owner of it all was somewhere
present in the house and in hiding. Why? The territory was
Alaskan. It had nothing to do with Canada, where he had come
from. Why, then, should the owner fear to show himself? What
object could he have in remaining hidden? He found several
possible answers, but none seemed to furnish an adequate
solution. The whole thing was an enigma that completely defeated
him. But he meant to solve it even if he was forced to remain a
month in the place. The only certainty he felt, and that for the
reason of his belief that the owner was watching him possibly at
that very moment, was that his invisible host possessed none of
the hostility which the Euralians on Loon Creek had displayed.
Had it been otherwise, surely, long since, he would have
discovered it in a definite attack whilst engaged on his work of
unjustifiable intrusion and search.</p>

<p class='c010'>However, it was all useless speculation. There was nothing
further to be gained by it. Possibly the bureau behind him might
have told him something. But there it was. A man’s private papers
were sacred. And he could not outrage such sense of honour as the
traffic of gold had left to him. No. He would go to the bed he
had selected and—see what happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood up and knocked out his pipe on the stone-built
fireplace and moved quickly, but without attempting to conceal
his movements, from the room.</p>

    <div>THE EYES IN THE NIGHT</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>A belated sense of humour was stirring in Bill
Wilder as he passed on to the quarters he had selected for his
occupation. The room, he felt certain, was that usually occupied
by his invisible hosts. Convinced of their secret surveillance of
his movements he believed they would surely witness his audacious
usurpation of their private apartment. It was the thought of this
that brought the smile to his eyes. He was wondering what form
their very natural resentment would take, for he had no doubt
whatever as to what would happen with the position reversed.
Anyway, he felt he was playing a trump card for bringing them
into the open, and that, at present, was the thing he most
desired. He would chance the rest. Meanwhile further speculation
was useless, and he shrugged his broad shoulders, and his smile
vanished under his resolve. He was determined on a prolonged
vigil. He would pretend sleep and—await developments.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was his purpose. But he failed to reckon with Nature and
a vigorous, healthy body. And, furthermore, he had forgotten the
oppressive humidity which weighed heavily upon the faculties. He
had also forgotten that he had been bodily occupied for something
like eighteen hours of the endless daylight. So it came that
within five minutes of flinging himself fully dressed upon the
dishevelled bed he fell into a deep slumber of the completely
weary.</p>

<p class='c010'>How long he slept he never knew. He was dreaming chaotically.
He seemed to be deeply concerned with a hideously misshapen
mountain from the sight of which it was impossible to escape. It
was lofty, and heavily snow-clad, and its fantastic shape
continually changed, assuming absurd likenesses to still more
stupid things. First it looked like his block of offices in
Placer. Then it resembled the Irishman Mike, with flaming top
instead of red hair. Then, again, it somehow flattened out to a
burlesque of the barren surroundings of Loon Creek, only to leap
again into the shape of a golden domed palace with a watch tower
reaching far up into the clouds. The last kaleidoscopic variation
it assumed was the huge head of a dark-faced man, crowned with
snow-white hair that streamed down over shoulders completely
hidden under its dense cloak, and with a pair of eyes flaming
with a fire that became agony to gaze upon. It was the lurid
horror of those eyes that finally startled him into actual
wakefulness. And he found himself sitting on the side of his bed
staring at something that sufficiently resembled the nightmare
horror of his dream to leave him in doubt of its reality.</p>

<p class='c010'>He passed a sweating palm across his forehead. It was a
gesture of uncertainty. Then, in a moment, full realisation came,
and he leapt to his feet and his challenge rang out vital and
determined.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a move!” he cried. “Move and you’re dead as mutton!
You’re covered! An’, sure as God, I’ll drop you at the first
sign!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He moved a step forward. His body was half crouching, and his
fully loaded automatic pistol was leading threateningly.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no movement in response to his threat and he
remained just where his first step had carried him, while
horrified curiosity, as he gazed on the spectacle framed between
the silken curtains of the arched entrance to the room, replaced
his urgency of a moment before.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a man and a woman. And they were standing side by side.
They were both something diminutive. Particularly was this the
case in the woman. The man was sturdily built, with lank,
snow-white hair that reached from the crown of his head, and hung
down upon his broad shoulders. A long, snowy beard covered his
chest with such luxuriance that it almost seemed part of the mane
that flowed down to his shoulders. But all this, striking as it
was to the just awakened man, was quickly lost sight of in the
painful vision of a pair of eyeless sockets that gaped at him,
filled and surrounded with vivid inflammation.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was in rough clothing not dissimilar from that which
Wilder himself was wearing. His sturdy body was coatless and clad
in a simple grey flannel shirt, while his nether garments were of
the common moleskin type. He was old, but how old Wilder could
not estimate with any certainty. His eyelessness, and his
snow-white hair and beard made the task impossible. One thing
alone impressed the onlooker in those first startled moments. The
man was blind, and his skin, in sharp contrast with his hair, was
of a darkish yellow. In a moment he had realised the truth of his
original estimate of the nationality of his unwilling hosts.</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman at the blindman’s side was a quaint, pathetic little
figure. She, too, was old, with greying black hair. She was clad
in something in the nature of a silken kimono, and looked as
fragile as a figure of exquisite porcelain. Her slightly slanting
black eyes were steadily searching the face of the white intruder
while she stood clasping the hand of the man at her side, in a
manner suggesting motherly solicitude. There was nothing
resentful in her gaze. It was simply appealing, troubled,
appraising.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whiteman’s order held them. They remained motionless,
without a word or sign, just where they had been discovered. It
was almost as if, like naughty children, they were awaiting the
expected chiding following upon some escapade in which they had
been found out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Realising their submission Wilder’s attitude underwent a
change. He dismissed his tone of sharp authority, but retained
his threatening gun in evidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If you’ve a notion to come out into the open instead of
spying around in hiding I’ll put this gun up, and we can talk,”
he said, with a look in his eyes closely approaching a smile.
“You see, I knew you were around, and only took possession of
your room in the hope of bringing you out into daylight. Guess
you’ve nothing to worry with if ther’s no monkey-play doing.
Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He eyed them both searchingly while he spoke, but it was the
queer little, troubled-eyed woman whom he really addressed. The
painful fascination of the man’s terrible eyes had passed leaving
behind only a feeling of nausea.</p>

<p class='c010'>After the briefest hesitation the woman spoke. She spoke in
good enough English with just the faintest foreign accent and
occasional awkward twist in her phraseology. Her voice was low
and infinitely sweet, and her whole manner suggested intense
relief from some overwhelming burden of terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We feared it was the man, Usak, come back,” she said. “He say
he would come, and we look for him all the time. But you are
white. Oh, yes. You are not the Indian that he is. You come like
all those others who look for the thing this country has to give.
It is so? Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>With the mention of the Indian whom Wilder knew to have been
the servant of the murdered Marty Le Gros there came a movement
on the part of the blindman. It was a gesture, sudden and almost
forceful. And the hand that made it was that which the woman
beside him was grasping. He half turned as though about to speak.
But he remained silent, obviously restraining himself with
difficulty.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder saw the movement. He realised the man’s sudden
disquiet. And he understood. A feeling of elation swept over him.
These people feared the coming of Usak. These two strange, shy
creatures in their far-off secret home. And Usak had threatened
them with his return. Why?</p>

<p class='c010'>Suppressing his elation Wilder smiled down at the woman, so
helpless, so appealing in the terror she was unable to
conceal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said almost gently. “I’m not Usak. I’m just a
whiteman with two companions. Guess they’re white, too. You see,
we came right on this place of yours without knowing about it.
You don’t need to be worried. But I got to make a big talk with
you before I quit. And seeing ther’s not a big diff’rence between
day an’ night in this queer country do you feel like making that
swell hall of yours below and sitting around for that talk? Do
you? Both?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s gentleness was the outcome of an irresistible feeling
of pity for the frightened woman. It had nothing to do with the
thing he had in mind. The name of Usak was uppermost with him
now, and he knew that one, at least, of these strange figures was
in some way deeply connected with the ugly riddle it was his work
to solve. His chivalry refused to associate the woman with it. It
was different, however, with the man for all his terrible
sightlessness. The man replied to him immediately and his voice
was harsh and cold. Its tone was wholly uncompromising.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We can talk,” he said shortly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s whole manner hardened on the instant. And his answer
came sharply, and his tone was no less uncompromising than that
of the other.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right,” he said. “Lead the way down. And don’t
forget ther’s a ‘forty-five’ gun right behind you all the
way.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder had long since learned the lessons of a country in
which chance seemed to be the dominating factor of life. His hard
schooling in the wide scattered goldfields of Yukon Territory had
forced the conviction on him that chance was a better servant in
this northern country than hard sense. And he knew now that sheer
chance had flung him stumbling upon something that, if not
actually the heart of the mystery of the murder of Marty Le Gros
by the Euralians, was at least no mean key to it.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the woman’s mention of the Indian, Usak, his mind had leapt
back to the story which George Raymes had been able, however
inadequately, to piece together from his old police reports.
Usak, he remembered, was the husband of the squaw who had been
murdered. These two people feared his coming so that they
completely hid themselves at the approach of strangers. Usak had
<em>threatened</em> them with his return. Therefore he had
visited them before. For what purpose? They were frightened for
their lives of him. Why should they be? Usak’s squaw had been
murdered by—Euralians.</p>

<p class='c010'>Surveying the sturdy back of the white-haired man, blinded,
helpless, being led by the pathetic, devoted woman at his side,
as he shepherded them to the hall below, he remembered once long
ago, in his chequered career in Placer, to have seen a man whose
eyes had been gouged in a bar-room fight. He remembered the
hideous spectacle he had been left, and he knew that the man he
had just discovered had endured the same terrible, inhuman,
treatment. Usak? Was that the source of the terror he had
inspired?</p>

<p class='c010'>Reaching the hall his hosts took up their position standing
near the centre, stone-built fireplace. They had faced about so
that they confronted him, and Wilder understood the woman had
simply obeyed the man’s unspoken command.</p>

<p class='c010'>The harsh voice of the blindman jarred on the quiet of the
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are an intruder,” he declared, his eyeless sockets turned
unerringly on the whiteman’s face. “You invade our home unbidden.
You threaten us with your gun unprovoked. You say you are a
whiteman. We are helpless. I cannot even see you, and my wife is
defenceless. Well?” He shrugged with infinite contempt. “You
demand talk with us. Go on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s impulse was to retort sharply. But he restrained it.
Where there should have been pity for a blindman living out a
darkened life in these far-off mountains there was only
antagonism and instant prejudice. He understood how it came well
enough. Instinct as well as swift conclusion warned him that
behind those eyeless sockets there dwelt a mind driven by a
nature something evil. For the moment, however, he must adopt
conciliation. Any other course would, in all probability, defeat
his ends. So his tone became that of easy moderation. He
laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess I’m all you reckon, sir,” he said. “Yes, I’m an
intruder, and I need to pass you a hundred apologies. But what
else could I do? Anyway, the best now would be to hand you the
meaning of the thing I’m doing. You see, I’m out looking for
things. The sort of things this queer valley looks like handing
out. I’m on a big prospect, and these hills look to be full of
the things I want. This is the second year I’ve been on the
trail, east, and west, and north, and now—well, I guess it hasn’t
been for nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oil? You’ve found the oil this valley is full of?” The
blindman’s question came sharply, but without alarm. His tone had
lost something of its harshness, and Wilder was satisfied. With
deliberation, and almost ostentatiously, he put his automatic
pistol back into his hip pocket. And he knew that the quick eyes
of the woman were watching his movements and conveying the story
of them voicelessly, through her hand clasp, to the man. Then he
moved over to the chair which was turned about from the bureau,
and flung himself into it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe,” he said. Then he indicated the couch which stood
nearby to a tall carved wooden screen. “Won’t you sit?” he went
on pleasantly. “It’s not for me to offer you a seat in your own
house, but—” He broke off with a light laugh. “Maybe we’ll be
quite a while talking.” His whole manner had assumed the
cordiality he intended. There was a moment of hesitation. Then,
without a word, the woman led her charge across to the dusty
couch. But she did not move directly across. The couch stood
opposite where they stood yet she led the man making a deliberate
detour and Wilder was puzzled. Then, glancing down at the floor,
he realised something which had hitherto escaped him. A large
ugly stain of brown was splashed on the polished flooring.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no mistaking it. He recognised it instantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was unquestionably a blood-stain, and by its extent he
judged it to be blood from a mortal wound. His questioning gaze
sought the two queer figures at once. The woman had carefully
avoided it, and he interpreted her action in the only way
possible. She evidently understood the origin of that stain, and
repugnance inspired her movements.</p>

<p class='c010'>They sat themselves on the couch side by side and Wilder went
on as though nothing had distracted his attention. He turned his
chair so that he faced them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, ther’s oil in this valley,” he said. “My two friends
reckon there’s enough oil to feed the whole world. But I’ve got
scruples,” he laughed, “for all you may be guessing the other
way. Say, before I get busy farther up the creek I’d be glad to
know just how we stand. You’re here on an oil play? And I’m not
yearning for trouble. Is this oil game your play? Have you a
concession? Am I butting in on a big commercial proposition
that’s already established? I’d be glad to know, Mr.—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder broke off invitingly. Yet, for all there were signs of
the mollifying effect of his attitude in the man, several moments
passed before a reply was forthcoming.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last the snow-white head inclined affirmatively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You have scruples,” he said. “You desire not to butt in. Yet
you invade my house. You ransack it. You treat it so as it is
your right to do these things. You threaten with your gun when I
come forth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He shrugged. But this time it was without any display of
feeling. He was calmly questioning, and his attitude displayed a
suspicion of puzzlement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder suddenly squared himself in his chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here,” he cried. “Let’s be frank. My name’s Wilder. Bill
Wilder. I’m a gold man first and foremost. After that, why, I
guess I’m just as much an adventurer as most of the folk of this
Northland. That’s all right. I’m not out to rob a soul of
anything he’s a right to. And as for the things you guess I had
no right to do, just think a bit. Here I find a house without a
sign of life. You choose to hide yourselves up. Well? A derelict
house here in the Arctic? Why, I guess I’ve as much right to
search it as to search for anything else this country’s got to
show us. As for the gun play it seems to me a man has every right
to protect himself when folks sneak in on him in the night.
That’s my answer to all that’s worrying you. And my name, as I
said, is Wilder. Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a sweeping bluntness about the challenge that should
have been irresistible. Wilder waited for the answer he demanded
while reserving a trump card to play in case of refusal.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no change in the blindman’s attitude. There was no
movement. His yellow face remained sphinx-like.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe I should not blame you,” he said, in his harsh fashion.
“You make a good case. But—I am blind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here,” he went on, in imitation of the other, with a slight
gesture of his disengaged hand, “I will not tell you the things
you ask. But I tell you some other. This valley is the great oil
bed of these mountains, and the oil is being tapped. If you touch
on this oil you will never leave the valley alive. Those who are
working it have been doing so for many years. It is their
established right, for no one has denied them in all the years.
No one has come near. They find it and work it. It is equity. I
have no place in this thing. I am—blind.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s eyes hardened. He glanced from the man to the woman.
In the latter’s eyes was a look of renewed apprehension, almost
of pleading, and he felt that she was waiting for the effect of
her man’s words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you fear to tell me—who you are?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I fear nothing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing? Yet you fear the coming of this man you call—Usak.
You fear the sight of every stranger?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s gaze was on the anxious face of the woman. His words
were for her benefit. But they had an unexpected effect. The
blindman suddenly unbent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is as I said,” he declared, his tone moderating but
assuming a bitterness of real feeling. “I fear no one and
nothing. I am blind. I am completely alone, but for my good wife.
I live through her hands, her eyes, her will. What is the worst
that may happen? Death? It is nothing—now. I am a dead man to the
world—now. I am blind. Once it was not so. Once in this home,
here in this valley, there were servants who worked at my
command. There were many interests in my life. Now it is changed.
The light has gone out, and with it have passed those who obeyed
my will, those who depended for their well-being on my word. It
is the way of such service. Rats never fail to quit the doomed
ship,” he cried bitterly. “I have nothing to fear. Least of
all—death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not even—punishment?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s hazard came instantly. It was well calculated. The
blood-stain on the floor was within his view. Then there was the
story of Marty Le Gros, and of Usak, who inspired such terror in
the woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>The yellow man started. It was as if an effort of will was
striving for vision through his empty sockets. For a moment he
made no answer, and headlong panic had returned to the woman’s
eyes. It was the latter that removed the last shadow of doubt
from Wilder’s mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Punishment? For what?” The man spoke in a low, fierce
voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder thought swiftly before replying. He understood that he
was right up against the stone wall of the yellow man’s
determination. There was only one course left him. If he could
not climb it he must batter it to ruins. His earlier hazard was a
small enough thing compared with the decision he took now. He
rose from his chair and stood towering over the diminutive pair
on the couch. His eyes were coldly compelling, and his whole
manner was carefully calculated for its effect upon the helpless
little woman, whom he could not help pitying.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here,” he cried sharply. “Let’s cut this fencing right out.
You refuse to pass me the name you are known by. You refuse to
tell me the meaning of this home hidden beyond human sight in a
valley that’s full to the lips of oil. Well, I guess I’ll hand
you the story you’re scared to hand me. You reckon you don’t fear
a thing. Psha! You can’t get away with that play. It wouldn’t
leave a two-year-old kid guessing. I’m quitting now. I’ve brought
you into the open, an’ I’ve located in you an answer to a hundred
guesses. I’m quitting now, but you won’t be left unwatched. You
won’t get a chance to make a get-away. You’ve had mostly fifteen
years to do that, an’ I don’t know why you stopped around with
the man, Usak, threatening to come right back on you. Maybe
because you’re blind and deserted. Maybe because you’ve a mighty
big stake lying around. Maybe it’s because ther’s other queer
folk of your own race, who, for their own reasons, don’t fancy
letting you quit. It don’t matter. What does matter is I’m
quitting now because this is Alaskan Territory. I’m going down
country to get things fixed with the United States authority to
have you brought right into our country to tell us how the
missionary, Marty Le Gros was murdered by the Euralians who
people these hills, and who I guess are nothing but a crowd of
Japanese pirates out grabbing in whiteman’s territory. You’re
scared of nothing, eh? Can you face that? Can you face the return
of the man, Usak, whose wife was murdered at the same time? Can
you tell us why they were murdered, and what happened to the
great gold ‘strike’ that poor darn feller made? I’m quitting now
just to fix this thing. An’ my boys’ll see you make no get-away
meanwhile. And as for your threat of the Euralian pirates working
the oil on this valley, that cuts no sort of ice with us. We’ve
been fighting these folk a year an’ more. You see, we’re officers
of the Canadian Police.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The imagination, the sweeping grasp of the clear-thinking mind
that had lifted Bill Wilder from the depths of the whirlpool of
humanity that had early flooded the gold regions of the North, to
the highest pinnacle of success in a traffic wherein vision and
courage were the chief essentials, had served him now far better
than he knew.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first spoken words of the little Japanese woman in her
terror had welded a hundred links together into a connected chain
such as no amount of ordinary labour in investigation could have
supplied him with.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no question except the given names of these people
left in his mind. There were convictions that perhaps needed
corroboration to reduce them to concrete facts. But that caused
him no worry. It had been said of Wilder that half a story was
all he needed, he could always supply the rest. It was so in the
present case.</p>

<p class='c010'>He left the house without a doubt remaining. This place was
the home of the Euralian organization, or had been before that
fantastic figure of avenging had left the man he had just parted
from with eyeless sockets. What scenes had been enacted there he
could only guess at. But there it was, safely hidden, with its
watch tower, the heart of a natural fortress located with the
profoundest judgment for the purposes desired. And he was
convinced, that, at any rate, the man who still lived his
darkened life there was surely one of the instruments, if not the
actual instrument, through which the man, Marty Le Gros, had met
his death. He was one of the Euralians, and, like as not, the
chief organizing head, since deposed through his physical
disability by his lawless subjects. Furthermore he had finally
satisfied himself that he had achieved the thing he had set out
to accomplish. The Euralians as they called themselves were
definitely of Japanese origin.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he passed into the surrounding woods the immensity of the
truth he had stumbled upon came home to him in an almost
overwhelming rush. The Yellow Peril which the world had talked
of, feared, and politically discussed for over a decade, had
suddenly become a reality to him. Here was just one little branch
of it. And the manner of it gave point to the subtle, secret
fashion in which it was being developed. Imagination was a-riot.
These people were Japanese. They were probably a hardy people
from northern Japan, under the control of a carefully chosen
leader of capacity and knowledge, such as he realised the man he
had just left to have been before his disaster of blindness. They
were imported through the far-hidden northern inlets to the
country on which, leech-like, they had battened. They came, a
sea-faring race, over the northern waters, and set about the
simple task of possessing this far, almost unpeopled territory,
and extracting its wealth for their own service. And what became
of that wealth, mineral and animal? What of the furs which they
stole, or traded with the Eskimo? What of the oil of this valley?
What of the unguessed wealth of coal deposits which were believed
to exist? The gold, too, and the hundred and one other raw
materials which littered this far-off, unexplored land?</p>

<p class='c010'>The northern seas; the great harbours of the northern coasts,
lost from view of the few scattered white folks, hidden amongst
rugged, snow-capped hills, and more than half their time
completely icebound. It was simple, so very simple to the
north-men of Japan, who were born sailors. Doubtless a steady
traffic among those hidden inlets went on, and disguised
freighters passed to-and-fro between the Alaskan coast and the
remoter ports of the land of Nippon.</p>

<p class='c010'>And meanwhile the penetration of this whiteman’s country was
steadily progressing. Who could say the extent of that
penetration? It was southern California over again. And the
invaders were only waiting, waiting for the day to dawn when—</p>

<p class='c010'>The breaking of bush just behind him as he passed on towards
the creek brought him to a halt. He faced about alertly and his
hand shot into the pocket where his automatic pistol lay ready
for use. But it was withdrawn empty almost immediately. The
diminutive woman with the slanting, terrified eyes broke from the
undergrowth, something breathless from her exertion, and stood
before him.</p>

<p class='c010'>His eyes were smiling with a kindliness he made no attempt to
disguise at sight of her. The memory of her devotion to her
sightless man was uppermost for all he had fathomed the meaning
of their presence on the river. She seemed to him a gentle
creature, hopelessly condemned to a task of utter self-sacrifice.
And he deplored the painful terror under which she suffered so
acutely. The shame and pity of it all touched him deeply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, mam,” he said, in a re-assuring tone, “you took a big
chance coming that way. I’m guessing for the thing that set you
worrying to come up with me on the run in a heat liable to hand
apoplexy to a brass image.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was no re-assurance in the urgent gaze that looked
up into his face. The poor creature’s bosom heaved with obvious
emotion. She opened her almost colourless lips to speak, but no
sound came. Instead she closed them again and glanced behind her
fearfully.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder understood. He had supposed her to be simply a
messenger. Now he realised she feared discovery by the blindman
she had left behind her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently she turned to him again, and thrust one thin,
delicate hand into the bosom of her gown where it remained while
she flung a terrified inquiry at him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You go so to make it that they come and take him, and kill
him, for the killing of the miss—the man, Le Gros?” she shook her
head violently. “No, no!” she cried passionately. “He not kill Le
Gros! They must not kill <em>him</em>. Sate kill Le Gros, and
Usak come and kill Sate, and all the men. He fight to kill my
Hela, too. But he put out his eyes. You are officer police. The
great Canadian Police. You know good what is right, what is
wrong. I tell you all. I tell you all the truth. My Hela not kill
no man. It our dead son kill this man, an’ the other. I know.
Hela tell me. He tell me all.” The smile had passed from Wilder’s
eyes as he listened to the almost breathless, headlong rush of
the poor creature’s desperate appeal for her man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did he send you to say this?” he asked, knowing well that the
man could not have inspired such acting in her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hela send me?” The woman’s eyes widened. “No! Oh, no! If he
know I am come then I—I know no more. Hela send me? No! I come
for him. I come so you know all the thing he will not tell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because I die if you send and kill my Hela,” she cried, with
a world of despair in the simple declaration.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder stood for a moment thinking deeply. He turned from the
pathetic figure which somehow distracted his judgment. And he
knew that he must decide quickly and make no mistake.</p>

<p class='c010'>Finally he turned to her again. And the smile had returned to
his steady eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me so I can understand,” he said gently. “Tell me all
there is to it, just the truth. Tell me who you are, and what
you’re doing around this valley. And if you show me the whole
thing right, and if your—Hela—did not kill, then you need have no
sort of worry he’ll come to harm through me. You get that? Pass
me the story, and make it short. But it’s got to be sheer
truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman’s hand remained buried in the bosom of her gown, and
now she raised the other, and, a picture of submission and
humility, she stood with it pressed over that which was hidden in
her bosom. Her black eyes were less fearful, her lined cheeks
were less drawn. Her whole appearance suggested the passing of
something of the weight of terror under which she had been
labouring.</p>

<p class='c010'>She began her story at once. She spoke quietly, in contrast
with her recent emotion, and in the curious broken phraseology
which denoted her rare use of a tongue she otherwise knew well
enough.</p>

<p class='c010'>She told him that her man was Count Ukisama—Hela Ukisama—and
that she was his wife, Crysa. She told him that he was the head,
and original organizer of the people who were called the
Euralians. She told him they came, as he had already guessed,
from Northern Japan, and were engaged in a great traffic in furs
with the Eskimo, which were secretly exported in whalers from the
far northern harbours of the country. But she warned him this was
not the whole trade. There was oil and coal. But most desired of
all was the gold which they had found in these northern valleys
for years.</p>

<p class='c010'>Close questioning, as she proceeded, quickly showed Wilder
that she was completely ignorant of the methods by which this
traffic was carried on. She knew nothing of the hideous murder
and piracy which was the whole story of these yellow marauders.
Obviously she was told by her husband only those things he
considered were sufficient for her to know.</p>

<p class='c010'>When she came to the story of Marty Le Gros, and his gold
“strike,” it was clearly different. Here she was apparently aware
of every detail, and she made it plain that after the coming of
Usak, and Ukisama had been so inhumanly blinded, she had forced
her husband to tell her the true meaning of the terrible thing
that had happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a story that lost nothing of its awful significance
from her broken and sometimes almost incoherent way of telling
it. He learnt how Ukisama and his son Sate had heard of Le Gros’
“strike,” and how they strove by every means in their power to
jump in on it. How they had searched Loon Creek from end to end,
and finally abandoned their search convinced that the missionary
had given that as the locality simply to mislead. Then at once
they became angry and were determined to make him yield them his
secret.</p>

<p class='c010'>She told him of the descent upon the mission at Fox Bluff,
where they meant to wring his secret from him, and how they had
utterly failed through the impetuosity of her son, Sate, who,
when the missionary prepared to defend himself with his guns,
fired a reckless shot which mortally wounded him. Hela, she
declared, deplored the act as ruining his chance of learning the
man’s secret. Then she declared that the squaw of the man Usak
had interfered, and again the hot-headed Sate had taken the
matter into his own hands and shot her down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And your Hela, this boy’s father, just looked on while this
was done?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s question came sharply when the woman narrated this
incredible detail of her story with an air of entirely honest
conviction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, no,” she cried, and hastily launched a torrential defence
of her blinded charge.</p>

<p class='c010'>She denied flatly that her husband desired to harm a hair of
the head of anyone. But Sate was a wild youth whom none could
tame, and least of all his father. No. When his father found what
had been done he became scared, and it was then he did the only
thing left him. He fired the mission in the hope of hiding up his
son’s crime. Then she said they hastened away, and came up the
river with all speed. But they had forgotten Usak, whom they had
not encountered. She did not know how it came, nor did her
husband. But Usak knew them. He knew their home here in this
valley, and he set out, and, by means they did not understand, he
arrived at this house before them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she detailed, with painful emotion the things that
happened with Usak’s coming. How he, a great, fierce Indian man,
stole in on the house and murdered their three servants—the rest
all being away with her husband. The last one, after being
mortally wounded by the Indian’s hunting knife, managing to reach
her in the sitting hall to warn her. He fell dead on the floor in
a pool of blood before her eyes. In her terror she had hastily
fled to the secret cellars which were under the house, where they
stored their trade in gold. And so she remained until Usak had
passed from the house of death. Then long afterwards, she learned
from Hela that he passed down the river and waited for their
return with the canoe. He waited hidden on the bank. And he shot
every man in the canoe as it passed, including their son Sate. He
spared none. Not one—except her husband. And so her husband made
the landing where she was awaiting him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then came the final tragedy. The Indian was in hiding. He had
kept pace with the boat, and when Hela landed he leapt out on him
to complete his terrible purpose. He fought not to kill but to
blind. And he succeeded. He left her man alive, but with his eyes
lying on his cheeks. And, before he went, he warned them what he
had done was sufficient for the time. But that later, after a
long time, he would return and kill them both.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And he will come,” she wailed in conclusion. “For he is an
Indian, and his squaw was killed by our son. He will come. Oh,
yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yet you stay here? Why?” Again came Wilder’s sharp question.
He had steeled himself against the pity which the woman’s
unutterable despair inspired.</p>

<p class='c010'>The little creature shook her head in complete
helplessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How we go?” she asked. “It cannot be. He is blind. We are
alone. The men leave us now he is blind. They trade for
themselves. Hela no longer has power. They laugh in his face if
he make order for them to obey. No. And they will not let him go
either. They keep him here. They know. If he go back to Japan
then another is sent who sees. Then these men no longer trade for
themselves. No. They will not let him go. They keep him here.
They pass us food. They let them not know in Japan the thing it
is. An’ so they work the oil, and coal, and gold. And they travel
far for the furs. And so it is. And then sometime Usak will come
again, and then—and then—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly she withdrew the hand which had remained all the time
she was telling her story in the bosom of her dress. It was
grasping a large, folded paper. She held it out, literally
thrusting it at Wilder, who took it from her with gravely
questioning eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it?” he demanded, and curiosity had replaced the
sharpness in his voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The plan of the gold. The gold of this Marty Le Gros. It is
for you. I give it. So you will make it that Usak not come again
to kill. You, an officer police.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder opened the paper and glanced at it. A clear exact
drawing was inscribed on its discoloured surface. It was a map in
minute detail, and he re-folded it quickly while his gaze
searched the urgent eyes raised to his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You give me this?” he said, in a quiet fashion that revealed
none of the surge of excitement with which he was suddenly
filled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The little woman who had called herself Crysa Ukisama suddenly
flung out her hands in an agony of vehement appeal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I give it. I take this thing from its place. This bad thing,
which is evil to us. He not know I take it. Oh, no. Sate find it
in the house of the missionary before they fire it. And he, Hela,
not give it up. No. Yet he cannot see it. He cannot find this
place. He say, too, it is evil, and no one must see it. So I hide
it all this long time, and keep it. But I know. So long we keep
it this Usak sure come back an’ kill us. It is for that bad paper
he come. It make him come. You take it. You have it. And maybe
you give it Usak so he will not come back. You officer police.
You know this man? You say, Hela Ukisama send it so he not come
an’ kill my Hela? You think that? You make him not come? Oh, I go
mad when he come bimeby. Yes. He kill my Hela. Same as he kill
all other man. I know. Oh!”</p>

<p class='c010'>With her last wailing cry Crysa buried her face in her
delicate, ageing hands, and a passion of emotion racked her frail
body. Wilder looked on in that helplessness which all men
experience in face of a woman’s outburst of genuine grief. He
waited. There was nothing else for him to do, and, presently, the
distraught creature recovered herself.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he reached out, and one hand came to rest on the
silken-clad shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ve told me the truth as far as you know it, my dear,” he
said very gently. “You’ve been hit hard. Darn hard. So hard I
don’t know just what to say to you. But you’ve done well passing
me that story and that paper, and I’m going to do all I know to
help you. See here, I’m not going to hand you out all sorts of
rash promises, but, if there’s a thing I can do to stop that
Indian man, Usak, getting around back here to hurt you, why, I’m
just going to do it. Go right back to your man now. He’s been
pretty badly punished. So badly it don’t seem to me he needs a
thing more of that sort this earth can hand him. And as for you
you’ve deserved none of it. Go back to him, and you have my given
word, that, just as hard as I’ve worked on the thing the p’lice
have sent me out to do, I’ll work to see no harm comes to you
from this Indian man. So long.”</p>

    <div>THE DREAM HILL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>It was less than ten weeks to the time when the
first fierce rush of winter might be expected. Already the days
were shortening down with their customary rush, and in a brief
time only the Caribou Valley, the river, the whole world of the
far North would be lost to sight under the white shroud of
battling elements, whose merciless warfare would be waged, with
only brief intervals of armistice, until such time as the summer
daylight dawned again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther McLeod was sitting in her doorway. It was the favoured
sitting place she usually selected when the flies and summer heat
made her rough kitchen something approaching the intolerable. The
intense heat of summer was lessening, but the ominous chill of
winter had not yet made itself felt. The sky had lost something
of its summer brilliance, and clouds were wont to bank heavily
with the threat of the coming season. But the flies remained.
They would undoubtedly remain until swept from the face of the
earth by the first heavy frost.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther was assiduously battling with one of her many tasks
while she talked in her simple, homely fashion to the Kid, who
was standing beside her. The foster-mother was frail but wiry,
and, with her greying brown hair and thin face, looked the
work-worn, happy philosopher she actually was. The Kid was a
picture of charming femininity for all the mannish mode of her
working clothes. Her pretty, rounded figure would not be denied
under the beaded caribou-skin parka that reached almost to her
knees. It was belted in about the waist, and a fierce-looking
hunting knife protruded from its slung sheath. Her wealth of fair
hair was supposed to be tightly coiled under the enveloping cap
drawn down over it. But it had fallen, as it usually fell, upon
her shoulders as though refusing to endure imprisonment when the
sun it loved to reflect was shining. Her blue eyes were deeply
thoughtful just now as they regarded the bowed head of the
beloved mother woman. She watched the nimble fingers spread the
buckskin patch out over the jagged rent in the seat of Perse’s
diminutive breeches.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know,” Hesther said, without looking up, “that little
feller Perse’ll make good someways. I can’t guess how. But his
queer little head’s plumb full of things that stick worse than
flies. An’ even though the seat of his pants drops right out,
which it’s mostly doing all the time, he’ll foller his notion
clear through to the end. He’s got the gold bug now, an’ spends
most all his time skiddin’ himself over rocks an’ things chasin’
what he wouldn’t rec’nise if he beat his pore little head right
up against it. I want to laff most all the time at his yarns. But
I just don’t. I’ve a hunch to see him do things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she agreed simply. Then her gaze was turned to the
distant river where its shining waters could just be seen beyond
the lank jack pines which surrounded the rambling house. “Perse
is the brightest of the bunch. You know, Mum, it’s kind of queer
us talking of the kids making good. We don’t ever stop to guess
how they’re going to do it—away up here, thousands of miles from,
from anywhere.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther flung a quick upward glance at the sweet
weather-tanned face that was no longer smiling. She was
wondering, for the girl’s tone had a note in it to which she was
quite unaccustomed. In a moment, however, her eyes had dropped
again to the thick patch cut from a caribou moccasin she was
endeavouring to make fast to the child’s tattered pants.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Trouble, Kid?” she asked, without looking up again.</p>

<p class='c010'>These two understood each other. A deep bond of sympathy and
love held them. The girl looked to this brave little widow of Jim
McLeod for sympathy and comfort in her distress as a child looks
to its mother. In affairs which needed capacity and strong
execution the position was reversed. This girl of twenty,
supported by the staunch Usak, strong in spirit and youthful
optimism, wide in her grasp of the affairs of the farm, was
responsible leader in all pertaining to their livelihood. Just
now the girl was troubled and Hesther realised that the Kid had
not abandoned her afternoon’s work at the corrals simply for idle
talk at her doorway. Her interrogation was calculated. She wanted
the girl to talk.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing worse than usual, Mum,” she said with a sigh. “It’ll
be two years since Ben Needham went, come next opening. We’ve
enough supplies to see us through six months. That’s the limit.
Usak’ll be along back before the freeze-up. Well, things depend
on the trade he brings back, and a winter trail to Placer. Do you
get it? By next spring our stores’ll be run out. If he brings
back good trade, and no accident happens along on our winter
trail, we’ll be in fairly good shape for awhile. But it just
means we can’t put in another season right through. I don’t see
how we can, unless we have mighty good luck. The thing’s as dead
as caribou meat without a market right alongside, like it was
when Ben Needham was around. We’re right here beyond the edge of
the world, and—and it can’t be done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean—quit? An’ with the boys coming along? The twins are
nearly sixteen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mother laboured on assiduously. The busy needle punched
its way through the tough buckskin with a sharp click as the
strong fingers plied it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid glanced down at the bowed figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The boys are good. Alg is a real man around the deer,” she
said, with a shadow of a smile in her pretty eyes. “Clarence is
hardening into a tough trail man. Usak reckons he’s a great
feller to have with him. But it’s not that, Mum. It’s the trade
these wretched Euralians beat us out of, and the distance to our
market.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is that all it is, Kid?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther’s needle was still. She was looking up with a pair of
soft, brown, questioning eyes, and the gentle mentality behind
them was reading the girl through and through with a certainty
that her transparent simplicity and innocence made possible.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can it be anything else, Mum? I guess ther’s nothing
around this farm to worry with but the feeding of hungry
mouths.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid had turned away. Again her eyes had sought the gleam
of waters sedately flowing on to their junction with the greater
river beyond.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mother shook her head. She leant forward on her door-sill
with her lean, bare arms folded over her offspring’s
clothing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t just see how it can be a thing else,” she admitted
promptly. “But I was thinkin’. You see, Kid, you’re over twenty.
Let’s see. Why, I guess you’re over twenty-one. Yes. Sure you
must be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And she deliberately began to count up the years that had
passed since the terrible time of the descent of the Euralians on
Fox Bluff. The girl watched the counting fingers, and the
abstracted gaze of the other as she reckoned up her sum.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But what’s that to do with it, Mum?” she cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure I’m over twenty-one, but—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther laughed gently. She shook her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There was no talk of quitting, whatever our trade, before you
made Placer last year with Usak. Say, Kid,” she went on, with
infinite sympathy and gentleness, “you’re a woman now. You aren’t
a—Kid—any longer. Does it tell you anything?” She raised a
pointing finger that was painfully work-worn, and admonished her.
“My dear, things are a heap different through a woman’s eyes.
When you’re a kid you’re mostly crazy with every new thing just
living can show you. When you’re a woman it isn’t life just to
live. Ther’s a whole book full o’ feelings, and wants, an’
notions start in to worry around, and the answer to ’em isn’t
found in the work of running a caribou farm, and beating a bunch
of scallawags who’re grabbing your trade. It isn’t found in
yearning to hand a stomach full o’ food to a crowd of kids you
love like brothers an’ sisters, either.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s eyes were searching for all their responsive smile,
and she made no attempt at denial.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wher’ d’you find the answer, Mum?” she asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>The older woman’s eye fell serious. A wistful yearning crept
into them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I found it in two things when I was your age,” she said.
“First it was in the excitement of fancy clothes, and parties,
where folks of my own age got around, boys and gals. Then I
guessed the answer to every yearning I had was in my Jim, and in
the bunch o’ scallawags he set crawling around my knees. Why,
Kid, this queer old world’s just got only one place where it can
make me feel good. It’s where my Jim’s babies are. You been down
to Placer. You and Usak. You’ve seen a big city where ther’s
white-folk like yourself, where ther’s lights burning on the
streets, and folks dancing, and parties racketing, and the boys
and gals are having quite a time. Then you get along back to the
farm here, and the kids, and, maybe, me. And I guess you’re
glad—for awhile.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl moved from the door-casing where she had been
leaning. She abruptly dropped to a seat on the door-sill beside
Hesther, and took possession of the thin, strong hand nearest to
her. There was a change in her as sudden as had been her
movements. Her eyes were shining and full of something Hesther
had never seen in them before. And somehow the magnetism of it,
her sudden, almost passionate earnestness claimed the older woman
and left her with a feeling that was something scared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me, Mum,” she cried, in a thrilling voice. “You haven’t
told me enough. You loved your Jim. Tell me just how you loved
him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It ’ud be easier to tell you how the thunder banks up in
summer and bursts over us,” Hesther replied with a headshake,
while her hand responded with sympathetic pressure to the clasp
of the girl’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>She gazed into the earnest face that so reminded her of the
father who had been slain so many years before, and the pretty,
fair-haired woman who had borne this foster child of hers. She
was wondering at the girl’s sudden passion of interest in her
love for the dead man who had given her such a wealth of simple
happiness. It was a new phase, and it meant something. And she
wondered what the meaning was.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Kid,” she went on. “I don’t reckon if I talked from now
to Kingdom Come I could ever tell you the thing you’re asking. He
was my man, just all of him. Could you feel so that any feller
could tell you to do the craziest thing and you’d want to get
busy right away doing it? Could you feel so that a feller’s frown
was better than the whole world’s smile? Could you feel you’d
rather have one man call you a crazy fool, and beat you over the
head with a club, than a hundred swell fellers bowing an’
scraping to hand you a good time? If you could feel all that
foolish stuff you’d know something how I loved my Jim. He was
mine, Kid,” she went on squeezing the girl’s plump hand in her
thin, strong fingers. “He was mine from the roof of his head to
the soles of his caribou moccasins, and life with him was full of
sunshine, even when the night of winter shut down. And he handed
me all these ‘God’s blessings’ that aren’t never content but that
I’m doing an’ making for them all the time. My, but I’d be glad
to have you feel all those things.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl nodded. Her eyes were deeply contemplative. She was
not looking at the woman beside her but gazing abstractedly into
space.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I think I could feel all that,” she said after awhile. “I—I
think I could feel so a man could beat me to death if he wanted
to. But—”</p>

<p class='c010'>She broke off. Then her gaze came back to the brown eyes
beside her, and a sort of ecstatic smile lit her eyes and
transformed her with its radiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But he’d have to be a great feller, with the courage of a
fighter. He’d have to be a man who ordered other folks around, a
man who knew no fear. A man who’d help a friend with his last
dollar or kill the enemy who hurt him. Yes,” she went on
dreamily, “and he’d have grey eyes, and a strong face that wasn’t
maybe too good-looking, and dark hair, and shoulders like a bull
caribou, and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be like to some feller you got a look at down in Placer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther had returned to her work, and drew a deep breath of
expectancy. But the girl ignored the challenge. She turned
suddenly and spoke with feverish eagerness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You felt that way, Mum, for your Jim?” she demanded. “That’s
the way all gals feel when they want—want to marry someone? Maybe
the Eskimo squaws feel that way, too? Just every woman? Is that
so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther smiled and nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. Tell me about him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The older woman’s philosophy had been swallowed up by the
irresistible emotions of her sex. She wanted to hear the story of
this child’s tender romance. She had made up her mind there was a
romance deeply hidden within her innocent heart, and that it had
taken place in that great gold city the girl had visited with
Usak. She was hungering for the story of it as every real woman
hungers for the love story of another, after having passed a
similar milestone in her own life. She was thrilled, and her calm
veins were afire with the recrudescence of her youth.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Kid suddenly came out of her dreaming, and smilingly
shook her head in a fashion that flooded the other with
disappointment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Mum,” she said. “There wasn’t a feller in Placer made me
feel that way. Not one. I—I was just thinking. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And it makes you want to quit and get around where life’s
real life?” Hesther cried incredulously. “An’ where there’s folks
and parties, and marrying, and you can have a place in it
all?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again the girl shook her head. This time all smiling had
passed. Her lips were no longer happily parted. And the corners
of her mouth were slightly depressed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, dear,” she said, with a decision which the other felt had
cost her an effort. “I don’t feel like quitting. I don’t want to
quit. Ever! I want to stay right here, till—till—I want to stay
here always with you, and the kids, and Usak. But sense says I
can’t. None of us can. We’ve played our game to the limit, an’ I
guess the cards are dead against us. We must go next year for—the
sake of those babies your Jim handed to you. I don’t just know
all it means. I don’t just see what we’re to do to earn our food.
But we’ll have to make the break, and take what the good God
hands—Hello!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl broke off. Her final exclamation came at the sight of
a little procession which hurried round the angle of the
building. It was headed by Mary Justicia and the adventurous
Perse. Alg was behind carrying Jane Constance in his sturdy arms,
while Gladys Anne clung to him yielding him her moral
support.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a subdued procession, and the Kid and the mother looked
for the thing which had affected them so seriously. Their
attention became promptly fixed on the dripping bundle of
humanity in the elder boy’s arms. An explanation was instantly
forthcoming in the coolest phraseology.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Darn crazy little buzzock reckoned to drown herself,” the boy
said with a grin. “Hadn’t no more sense than to fall off’n the
driftwood pile into six foot of water. We shaken most of it out
of her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mother was on her feet in a moment, and the child, despite
her liquid condition, was snatched to her eager bosom. And in her
anxiety everything else was completely forgotten.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You pore little bit,” she cried solicitously as she hugged
the moist bundle in her arms. Then she turned on the gawking
youth with which she was surrounded. She glanced swiftly over the
faces grinning up at her, and punctuated her survey with a
sweeping condemnation.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You bunch o’ hoodlams,” she cried. “The good God gave you the
image of Hisself, did He? Well, I guess He must ha’ forgot the
mush you need to think with. Be off with you. The whole bunch.
You, Mary Justicia, stay around an’ help me scrape the pore mite
clean. The rest of you get out o’ my sight. I don’t feel like
looking at any of you again—ever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She vanished into the house, a diminutive figure of righteous
indignation, and the Kid was left to the eager, laughing
explanations of the unimpressed culprits.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The kyak darted down the river on a stream that made its
progress something like the flight of an arrow. Its great length
and narrow width left it a crazy enough vessel to handle, but the
Kid had been born and bred to its manipulation, and she played
with it as she chose without concern for its crankiness. Her gun
lay in the bottom of the hide-built craft, for she was speeding
down towards the marshes in quest of water-fowl.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the rapid passing of the shortening northern day she knew
she would find the marsh alive with duck. Game was plentiful just
now. In another few weeks the approach of winter would drive the
migratory fowl south, where the waters remained open and winter
feed was to be had in abundance. The girl was pot-hunting, and
the full stocking of the farm larder was an important duty in her
routine of life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Silently, almost ghostlike, the dip of her paddle giving out
no sound, she sped on over the shining waters between high,
lichen-grown banks, that were mostly rock-bound and almost
completely sterile. It was a wild, broken stretch of country,
without any of the vegetation which was the inspiration of the
setting of the farm. It was without any graciousness, from the
southern hills to the northern limits containing the shallow
valley. But even so, to this girl, who had known the Caribou
Valley all her young life, there was intense attraction in every
detail of its familiar uncouthness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Quite abruptly she passed beyond the undulating, rock-bound
stretch, and shot into the jaws of a short but narrow canyon. For
no apparent reason the country about her suddenly reared itself
into a tumbled sea of low, broken hills that darkly overshadowed
the passage which the river had eaten through them. The gleaming
waters had lost their vivid, dancing light and assumed an almost
inky blackness. Their speed had increased, and they frothed and
churned as they beat against the facets of the encompassing
walls, as though in anger at a resistance they had never been
able to overcome.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl was gazing ahead at the far opening, where the hills
gave way to the wide muskeg which was her goal. It was at the
sort of giant gateway which was formed by two sheer sentry rocks
standing guard on either side of the river, overshadowing,
frowning, lofty, windswept and bare.</p>

<p class='c010'>A girlish impulse urged her. These two barren crests were
old-time friends of her childhood. The leaning summit of the hill
on the left bank was the dream place of childish fancy. It was
always windswept, even on the calmest day. It was beyond the
reach of the mosquitoes and flies abounding on the river. It was
free and open to the sunlight, which was getting shorter now with
every passing day. And, somehow, an hour passed on its chilly
summit never failed to inspire her heart with feelings freed from
the oppressive weight of the cares of her life below.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes. She would leave the feeding fowl to their evening meal.
For the present there was no shortage in the farm larder. The
marshes could wait till to-morrow. For the moment she felt deeply
in need of that consolation she never failed to find in this old
friend of her earlier years. She would pass an hour with it. She
would confide to it the story of those feelings and desires,
which, with every passing month, were absorbing her more and more
deeply. For she was restless, disturbed. As Hesther had
suggested, the dawning womanhood in her was crying out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, yes. She understood now. The life of the farm was no
longer the satisfying thing it had always been. Something was
amiss with her. A great, unrecognised longing had been urgent in
her for months past. And a glimmer of its meaning had come to her
while listening to Hesther’s endeavour to show her the thing
which her own love for her dead husband had been.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly she dipped her paddle and held it. Instantly her
light vessel swung about and headed up stream. Slowly,
laboriously it nosed in against the stream and glided gently up
to the familiar landing place.</p>

<p class='c010'>Leaping ashore, the Kid stooped and grasped the central struts
of her craft. Then she lifted it bodily out of the water, and set
it in safety on the broad strand.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The Kid was squatting trail fashion with her back thrust
against the smooth-worn, almost polished sides of a great
boulder. The chill wind was beating against her rounded cheeks.
There were moments when its nipping blast brought tears to her
eyes. And her soft, fair hair streamed from under her cap in
response to its rough caresses.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her eyrie was set more than a hundred feet above the rest of
the world about her. Her gaze was free to roam the length and
breadth of the valley below her. There was nothing whatsoever but
the limit of vision to deny her. Here she could feast herself
upon the world she had learned to love, with fancy free to riot
as it listed.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a wonderful panorama for all its harshness. Away to the
north lay endless miles of barren, low hills and shallow valleys
which lost themselves in the far-off purple of falling daylight.
To the south of her it was the same, except that the dying sun of
summer lolled heavily on the horizon, gleaming, blinding in its
last passion. To the east lay the farm and the corrals that
claimed all her working hours, and beyond that was the purple of
distance enshrouding lank, sparse, woodland bluffs whose stunted,
windswept tops cut sharp drawn lines against the far-off shadows.
It was all wide flung, and harsh, and infinitely small viewed
from her lofty crow’s-nest. And even the river, immediately
below, was no better than a silver ribbon dropped by some
careless hand on a carpet that was drab, and worn, and utterly
without beauty.</p>

<p class='c010'>But none of these claimed her now. The girl’s gaze was to the
westward. Even the hour was forgotten, and the spread of cold
grey cloud which the biting wind was driving down upon the world
out of the fierce north-east. Her gaze was on the dark line
beyond which flowed the mighty Hekor, where it beat the meeting
waters of the two rivers into a cauldron of boiling rapids. It
was on the great bluff of woodland which had sheltered her
original home, and beyond which lay the deserted Fort, which had
been the pulsing heart making life possible for them all. And she
was thinking, thinking of a man with “grey eyes, and a strong
face that wasn’t too good-looking, and dark hair, and shoulders
like a bull caribou.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He had said he would return, this man who called himself Bill
Wilder. He and his red-headed companion and the grey hard-bitten
creature he called Chilcoot. They had gone out into the far
North. The great, wide-open North with its treacherous smiling
summer masking a merciless wintry heart. Would he return? Would
he come again down the river? Would he forget, and pass right on
down to the city which contained his home? She wondered. And,
with each possibility that presented itself, a cold constriction
seemed to grip her strong young heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>How long had he said? She remembered. She had never forgotten.
She could never forget. The man’s smiling eyes had haunted her
ever since the first moment they had gazed so earnestly, so
kindly into hers. Oh, she knew nothing of whence he came or
whither he was bound. She knew nothing of the man he might be.
These things concerned her not at all. She had judged him in the
first moments of her meeting with him nearly two years ago, and
from the first words he had spoken in his easy way, and her
judgment had been of a splendid manhood that harmonised with the
deep woman instinct, which, for good or ill, is the final
tribunal of a woman’s life.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had been the ideal of everything that appealed to her in
manhood. She had learned her simple understanding of life amongst
the rough men of the northern trail. Here was a man recklessly
plunging into the far-off world, ready to face and battle with
every chance with which that world was crowded. He was fearless.
Yes. He was all she looked for in courage. He was a leader, a
strong, determined leader of men no less brave and adventurous
than himself. And as for the rest it was all there. She had seen
for herself. A great stature, a strong man’s face. And eyes that
calmly shone with honesty and kindliness.</p>

<p class='c010'>She sighed. Would he return? The hands about her knees broke
apart. They fell from about her knees, and she stirred, and
twisted her body round so that she sat with one hand on the bare
rock supporting it. She was facing round to the west.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why, why did she so long for his return? He had said he would
return in two years. Two years? That would not be up till next
opening. The winter ahead suddenly looked to be an interminable
period of waiting. Winter. And anything might happen to him
in—winter. Suddenly she became weakly anxious for his safety. She
knew the dangers. She knew the conditions of the country into
which he had gone. The Euralians. The desperate storms. The— But
she dismissed her fears. She remembered the man’s equipment. But
more than all she remembered his confident, commanding eyes. No.
Nothing could harm him. Nothing. Nothing. But would he remember.
Would he—?</p>

<p class='c010'>She started. Suddenly she sprang to her feet with the easy
agility of one of the young deer it was her work to handle. And
she stood against the sweeping breeze, at the very edge of the
ledge, silhouetted against the background of a dying sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The biting wind swept her hair across her eyes. She raised a
brown hand and thrust it aside and held its mass firmly, while
she stared out wide-eyed in amazement. Then she raised the other
hand, pointing, a thrill of excitement, and gladness, and hope,
surging through her heart. And as she stood, utterly unconscious
of the thing she did, words sprang to her lips and she counted
aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One! Two! Three! Yes. Five large and two small!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And with each numeral she uttered, her pointing hand moved
from one tiny distant object on the river to another.</p>

<p class='c010'>For awhile she remained spellbound by the vision. She
remembered. Oh, yes. There could be no mistake. Five large canoes
and two smaller. That had been the extent of Bill Wilder’s outfit
as she had first discovered it. It was he. He was coming up the
river. He had returned. And—he had returned sooner than he
promised.</p>

<p class='c010'>A wild tumult of feeling consumed her as she stared at the
distant procession of boats. Then, in a moment, a surge of colour
swept up into her cheeks, and a fierce panic of shame robbed her
of all her delight. She turned; tearing herself from the glad
sight, and fled headlong to her kyak below.</p>

    <div>BILL WILDER RE-APPEARS</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Hesther was perturbed, yet she was engaged on the
task of all tasks which appealed to her in her life’s
routine.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was wash-day. She was standing over a boiler of steaming
water, frothing with soap suds and full of a laundry made up of
the rainbow hues of a Joseph’s coat. The kitchen was reeking with
steam. It was also littered with piles of well-wrung garments
awaiting the services of Mary Justicia for transfer to the drying
ground outside. The swarming flies were more than usually sticky
in the humid atmosphere, and the prevailing confusion in the
rough living room was as splendid as the most ardent housewife
could have desired on such an occasion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Perturbation with Hesther could only have one source.
Something must be amiss with one of the large family for which
she held herself responsible. Nothing else could have disturbed
her equanimity. She was completely single-minded and even in her
emotions. Beyond the four walls of her house she had no concern.
She was utterly abandoned to the six young lives entrusted to her
efforts by her dead husband, and the girl who, from her earliest
infancy, had been called “the Kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was of the Kid she was thinking now. Their talk of the day
before had filled her with disquiet. The girl had denied so much,
and yet, to the patient mother-woman, there had been signs that
only afforded one interpretation.</p>

<p class='c010'>And now she was asking herself all the many questions which
her woman’s heart instinctively prompted. Who was the man? Where
was the man? When had the Kid encountered the man? What was he
like? How far had this thing gone that it had stirred the child
to a fever of excited interest in another woman’s love for her
man? She was mystified beyond words. None but trailmen and
trappers had come near them throughout the years. They were
mostly half-breeds and Eskimos, and one or two poor whites who
thought of nothing but the mean living they were able to scratch
out of this Euralian-ridden territory.</p>

<p class='c010'>No. It was none of these. Of that she was convinced. And for
all the girl’s denial her mind persistently turned to Placer.
There had been a definite change in the Kid, she fancied, since
her return from the gold city. A change which her keen anxiety of
the moment forthwith exaggerated. She felt that she must take
Usak into her confidence. Yes. When he returned from his summer
trip with Clarence, trading the trail-broken deer, she would
question him. She warned herself that it was imperative for all
it seemed like disloyalty, and distrust of the Kid’s denial. Yes.
That was the only course for her.</p>

<p class='c010'>She glanced up from her steaming tub where her busy hands were
rubbing and squeezing the highly coloured garments in the suds.
Mary Justicia had appeared in the doorway and was standing
outlined foggily in the steam.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those,” Hesther said, indicating the litter on the
rough-boarded table. “It’s a big wash, child,” she observed
contentedly, “but I guess we’ll get through in time for dinner.
You see we got all Janey’s stuff, an’ it’s that stained with mud
an’ the like it makes you wonder the sort o’ muck that comes down
the river.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mary Justicia seized on the garments. Then she paused and
turned with her arms full.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The kids are comin’ right along up from the river, Mum,” she
declared, dismissing her mother’s remarks under an interest much
more to her liking. “Guess they’re coming along up on the run,
an’ Alg’s with ’em. You wouldn’t say Perse had located something,
or—or got hurt? I didn’t just see him comin’ along with the
bunch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mother wiped the suds from her hands and dried them on her
overall.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s an hour an’ more to food,” she said, with a sharp
inquiry in her tone and look. “Wot’s got ’em beatin’ it to home
now? Alg should be along up at the corrals with the Kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She hurried to the door and looked out. Sure enough there was
a tailing procession of children racing for the house. But all
four of them were there. Perse was running last, behind the
toddling figure of Jane Constance.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>It was a breathless crew that broke into the steaming kitchen.
From the sixteen-year-old Alg down to the round, grubby-faced
Janey, with her mass of curling brown hair and dark eyes,
excitement was a-riot, and they hurled their amazing news at the
busy mother in a chorus that set her flourishing a half-wrung
garment at them in protest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, quit it, all of you!” she cried. “I haven’t ears all
over my head if you think I have. Outfit? What outfit? Here, quit
right away, the whole bunch. An’ you Alg, tell your crazy yarn
while I get right on with the wash. You ‘shoo’ the others right
out into the open, Mary Justicia, while Alg hands me his fairy
tale. They’ll be takin’ pneumonia in this steam else.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The elder girl obediently “shooed” the rest of the children
from the room, and stood guard in the doorway lest the avalanche
returned. But she was all eyes and ears for Alg who was simply
bursting with his astonishing news.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s an outfit come right up the river,” he began at once,
his eyes alight and dilating with an excitement he could scarcely
contain sufficiently to leave him coherent. “It’s a swell outfit
of white folk, ever so many of ’em. I guess they must ha’ come
through in the night an’ passed right up to the gravel flats
along up beyond the corrals. Guess they pitched camp three miles
up, an’ they got five big canoes, an’ all sorts of camp stuff.
Ther’s a feller with bright red hair, an’ two fellers who’re sort
of bosses. The rest are just river folk, an’ the like. It was
Perse located ’em, an’ I guess he come along and tell us, and we
went right up, an’—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Did you tell the Kid?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther’s sharp demand was the natural impulse which the boy’s
news stirred in her. The arrival of a strange outfit of white
folk on the river was a matter of serious enough importance in
their lives, but it was outside her province. Her real concern
was for her washing and all that that implied. The Kid, in the
absence of Usak, was her resource in such a situation. The boy
shook his rough head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I didn’t see her around as we came along back,” he said, “an’
I didn’t wait to chase her up. I guessed I best come along an’
tell you first.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mother nodded and wrung and rinsed a flannel garment as
though nothing else in the world mattered. She was thinking as
hard as a mind concentrated upon her manual effort would permit.
And somehow the result was sufficiently negative to leave her
without any inspiration beyond that the Kid should be told at
once so that there should be no delay in the responsibility of
the newly developed position finding the proper person to deal
with it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Beat it right up to the corrals,” she said at last, “an’
locate the Kid, and hand her your yarn, son.” Then the working of
her simple mind eased to its normal condition. “An’ when you done
that come right back to home, an’ don’t get running around
pecking at them folks. We don’t know who they are. Maybe they’re
a bum outfit o’ low down whites chasing after no good. You’re
mostly a grown feller, Alg, an’ you got women-folk around. I
guess it’s right up to you, an’ me, an’ the Kid, with Usak away,
an’ with strangers around. Now you get right along an’ beat it.
Food’ll be about ready against you get along back. An’ I’ll
finish the wash after. Ho, Mary, here’s another bunch to set out
dryin’.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Hesther was infinitely disturbed. Her perturbation on the
Kid’s account had been something very much less disturbing than
this sudden and totally unlooked for development. Strangers!
White strangers! Strangers on their river! What had they come
for? And, more than all, what manner of white folk were they? The
woman in her had taken alarm, for all she gave no sign. There was
the Kid and Mary. They were alone, without any sort of help
except Alg and the two or three half-breed Eskimo working about
the farm. At that moment she would have given all she possessed
to have had Usak on hand to look to for the protection she
desired.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was curious. For years she had lived under the threat of
the Euralian marauders who had passed through the country like a
devastating pestilence. They were foreigners. They were savages.
Their crimes were wanton in their cruelty. Yet the dread of them
failed to quicken her sturdy pulse by a single beat. Now,
however, at the coming of these men of her own race, it was
utterly different. A sort of stupefied panic suddenly descended
upon her, and her wash day had ceased to interest her. She
removed the boiler from her cook-stove, and prepared for the
mid-day meal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mary Justicia had abandoned her post at the doorway. She had
cleared the table of the litter of washing and was setting the
meal ready while her mother gave herself up to the work at the
cookstove, when a small head was thrust in at the doorway.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mum!”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a note of suppressed excitement in Perse’s eager
summons.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther turned from the stove on the instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You be off with you!” she cried. “Food won’t be—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tain’t food, Mum,” retorted the boy urgently, as he gazed
into the steam-filled room. “It’s a feller, a great big feller,
bigger than Usak, comin’ right along. What’ll I do? Tain’t any
use tryin’ to ‘shoo’ him. He’s too big fer that. Guess it
wouldn’t be any use Mary ‘shooin’’ him either. I—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther ran to the doorway. She stood framed in it, her thin,
bare arms folded across her spare bosom. It was an attitude that
might have suggested defiance. But at that moment there was only
a deepening panic surging in her mother heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>And standing there she beheld the approach of a man of unusual
stature. He was clad in trail-stained, hard clothing that by no
means helped his appearance. His buckskin coat was open, and
under it was revealed a plain cotton shirt that gaped wide at the
neck, about which was knotted a coloured scarf. His dark hair
hung loose below his low-pressed cap. But these things passed
unnoticed. For the woman was concerned only with the face of the
man, and the thing she was trying to read there. As he came up he
removed his cap and stood bareheaded before her. And he smiled
down into her troubled, inquiring face out of a pair of grey eyes
that never wavered for a moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guessed I’d best come right along down at once, mam,” he
said in easy, pleasant tones. “We pulled in up the river last
night And seeing things are kind of lonesome about here, and
we’re a biggish outfit of strangers such as maybe you weren’t
guessing to see about, I felt it might get you worried. Well, I
just want to make it so you don’t feel that way. We’re a gold
outfit figgering to prospect this river, and I’m running it. My
name’s Bill Wilder. It won’t tell you a thing, I fancy. But I
want to say right here that just so long as we’re around ther’s
not a feller in my bunch that’s going to worry you or yours
without getting a broken neck from me. That’s all I came along to
pass you. You see, mam, it’s a queer country full of queer folk,
and I sort of fancied making things easy for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman in Hesther was deeply stirred. The man’s whole
attitude was one of simple respect and kindliness. There was no
mistaking it, and her favourable judgment of him was as
instantaneous and headlong as had been her panic of the moment
before. It was the voice, the clear smiling eyes of this whiteman
stranger that claimed her ready confidence. For she was a woman
whose simplicity of heart dictated at all times.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, say, now, that’s real kind of you, sir,” she replied
beaming with genuine relief. “It surely is a rough country for a
lone woman with a bunch of God’s Blessings around her.” Then she
moved back into the house with an air of removing the hurriedly
set up defences of her home, and turned to Mary Justicia, while
the other children gawked at the stranger. “You’ll set another
platter, girl. I guess Mr. Wilder’ll take hash with us, if he
ain’t scared to death eating with a bunch of kids with the
manners of low-grade Injuns.” Then she smiled apologetically at
the man with his powerful shoulders and great height. “You see,
it’s wash-day with us, sir,” she went on, “an’ it ’ud take a wise
feller to rec’nise our kitchen from a spring fog. But the ducks
have been shot four days by the Kid, an’ I reckon they’ll eat as
tender as Thanksgiving turkey. Will you step right in
an’—welcome?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The cordiality of the little woman’s invitation was
irresistible. But Wilder shook his head in partial denial. Her
reference to “the Kid” had changed his original intention of
complete refusal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mam,” he said, “ordinarily I’d be mighty glad to take that
food with you all. But I guess I need to get back to camp in
awhile. You see, we only pulled in last night at sundown, and
ther’s a deal needs fixing when you’re runnin’ a bunch of
tough-skinned gold men. But I’d be glad to step in and yarn some
if wash-day permits.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s reputation amongst the men of his craft was that of
scrupulous straight dealing and honesty for all he was an astute
man of affairs in the business in which they trafficked. They
knew him for a man who never needed to sign when his word was
given. Beyond that they knew little of the real man. Amongst
those whom he counted as friends there was an infinitely warmer
side to the man. They saw the native simplicity and kindliness
which he usually kept closely hidden under a harder surface. But,
somehow, the real man was reserved for the eyes of such women as
he encountered. His chivalry for the sex was innate. It was no
make-believe veneer. To him it mattered nothing if a woman were
plain or beautiful, old or young. Even her morals had no power to
influence his attitude. A woman, with all her faults and virtues,
was just the most sacred creature that walked the earth. Good,
bad, or in a category between the two, she left the mundane gods
of daily life nothing comparable in their claim upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>His feelings, however, reduced him to no extravagant display
of sentiment towards women. On the contrary. He loved to regard
them as creatures created for the beautifying of human life,
companions on complete equality with man, except where the
disability of sex was involved. It was in such circumstances he
claimed man’s right to succour to the limit of his powers.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something of all this had stirred him at the sight of the
brown-eyed, work-worn woman with her “God’s Blessings,” as she
called them, about her. But it had had nothing to do with the
inspiration of his prompt visit to the homestead he had
discovered ten miles up from the mouth of the Caribou River. He
had contemplated this visit all the way down the long journey on
the Hekor River. He had visualized the existence of some such
home, and had determined to locate it. And the purpose had
remained in his mind ever since that day, two summers ago, when
the girl who was called “the Kid” had flung him her parting
invitation. Even now, as he bulked so hugely in the one real
chair the homestead afforded, and which was the rest place for
Hesther when her many labours permitted, he saw again in fancy
the girl’s frankly smiling blue eyes, full of delight and pride
at the masterly fashion in which she had piloted the great outfit
up the narrow channel of the Hekor rapids. Her pretty
weather-tanned face had lived with him every day of his long
sojourn in the desolate wastes farther north, and he had longed
for the time when he could run her to earth in that home which
she had told him lay ten miles from the mouth of the Caribou
River.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last it had come. And in how strange a fashion. It almost
looked as though Fate had taken a hand in bringing about the
thing he desired. It was not only his desire to look again upon
the sun-browned face of the girl who had so surely leapt into his
heart that had brought him to the Caribou River. It was the
diagram map, so carefully drawn by the dead Marty Le Gros’ hand,
which the terrified little Japanese woman had thrust upon him in
the hope of saving her blinded husband. <em>The great gold
“strike” of the dead missionary was on the Caribou River, and he
held the detailed key of it.</em></p>

<p class='c010'>He was thinking of the Kid now as he listened to the ripple of
talk which flowed so naturally from Hesther’s lips as she stood
over the savoury stew on the cook-stove.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It makes me want to laff,” she said, “you folks reckoning to
try out the Caribou for gold. You’re jest like my Perse, only you
don’t skid out the seat of your pants chasing the stuff. Say,
that kid—he’s nigh thirteen years—has the gold bug dead right,
an’ he reckons to locate it around this valley. I’d say you
couldn’t beat it, only you’re reckoning that way, too. Gold? Gee!
Gold on this mud an’ rock bottom? Why, you’ll need all the
dynamite in the world to loosen up this territory, ’cept where
it’s muskeg, an’ then you’ll need a mighty long life line to hit
bottom.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess you folks should know the valley, mam,” he admitted,
with a smile of amusement in his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther turned about from her work.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You aren’t thinking that?” she said quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, that’s a man all through. You reckon ther’s gold on
Caribou, and you’ll chase it to a finish. Say, my Perse ’ud just
love you to death for that.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder watched Mary Justicia moving silently around the room
preparing the table.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where did—Perse—get his notion from, mam?” Wilder inquired
disarmingly.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a moment Hesther’s brown eyes became serious. There crept
into them an abstracted far-off look. And in repose a curious
sadness marked her expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, the Kid’s father. The missionary, Marty Le Gros, who was
murdered by the Euralians nigh eighteen years back.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder started. A flood of excitement hurled through his body.
He almost sprang from the square, raw-hide seat of his chair. But
he controlled himself with an effort and spoke with a calmness
that betrayed nothing of his sudden emotion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You said Perse was only thirteen,” he argued.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so,” Hesther nodded, setting the tea-kettle to boil
beside the stew. Then she turned about to the two children
squatting on the doorstep. “That’s Perse,” she said, indicating
the boy who was listening avidly to the talk. “He’s only heard of
the yarn that the Kid’s pore father made a big ‘strike.’ I know
he made it. Jim and me—Jim’s my dead husband who used to run the
Fur Valley Store at Fort Cupar—handled the chunks of yellow stuff
he showed us. They were wonderful. Oh, yes, he made a big
‘strike’—somewhere. But I don’t guess it was on Caribou. We were
to have known. He was going to hand us the yarn. But he didn’t.
You see, they got after him, an’ murdered him. So no one ever
knew. You see Perse hasn’t a notion beyond Caribou. So he reckons
if ther’s gold anywhere in creation it must be on Caribou.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s a wise kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Because he thinks your way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. But say, mam, I guess you’re waiting to serve out that
food and I’m holding things up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman shook her head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Kid ain’t down from the corrals yet. We don’t eat till
she comes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man nodded and made no attempt to take his departure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see,” he said reflectively. Then he laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, mam,” he went on with a gesture of deprecation, “you’ve
got me guessing good. I’m just a gold man an’ not a highbrow
logician or guesser of riddles. You’re here with your bunch of
God’s Blessings, as you call these dandy kids of yours. You talk
of corrals as if you were running a swell cattle ranch. You talk
of the Kid’s father who was Marty Le Gros, a missionary, murdered
by Euralians eighteen years ago. An’ you haven’t even spoke as if
you had any sort of name yourself. Well, as I said I’m just a
gold man chasing up a creek you don’t reckon to hold anything
better than mud and rock, but I’m liable to be a neighbour of
yours for something like a year at least. And if it isn’t putting
you about I’d just love to sit and listen to anything you feel
like handing out.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the way it was said. It was so frankly ingenuous and
inviting. Hesther looked into the stranger’s grey eyes, and no
question remained in her mind. So she laughed in response and
shook her greying head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, living on the edge of the Arctic has quite a way of
cutting out the manners we’re brought up to,” she said at once.
“I’m Mrs. McLeod, and my man, Jim, as I said, was factor at Fort
Cupar. Well, he died.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For one thoughtful moment she glanced into the stew pot. Then
she dipped some steaming beans from a boiler and emptied them
into the stew. After that she turned again to the waiting man in
the chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is a reindeer farm. It’s a sort of crazy notion in a
way, but it’s handed us a living ever since Marty Le Gros, who
started it up, was murdered by the Euralian toughs. Will I hand
you the story of that? Or maybe you’re heard it? Most folks in
the North have.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t trouble to tell it, mam,” he said quickly. “It’s bad
med’cine that I’ve heard all about. And it’s not likely to hand
you comfort in the telling. So this was his farm?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure it was. He started it reckoning to build it up for his
little baby, Felice, who we call the Kid, and the Indian man,
Usak, who was his servant, ran it for him. Well, after he was
done up and his place was burnt out, Usak came along from here
and found his little kiddie flung into the bluff to die, or get
eaten by wolves and things. Usak was nigh crazy. But he claimed
the Kid and raised her on this farm, which he went on building
for her. When the Kid was about twelve my man Jim took ill and
died, and I came along right over from the store with my bits and
my kiddies, and just live with ’em. It helped me and mine, and it
helped the Kid and Usak some. And that’s all ther’ is to it. I’m
sort of foster-mother to the Kid. And we all scratch a living out
of Usak’s trading the trail-broke caribou with such Eskimo as the
Euralians have left within reach.” She laughed, shortly and
without mirth. “It’s nothing much to tell, sir, but there it is,
and you’re welcome to know it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman’s brief outline contained the whole drama of the
past eighteen years told without emphasis, almost as though it
were a simple matter of everyday occurrence. Years ago it might
have been different, but now—why, now only the present seriously
concerned her, and that was the preparation of food and the
execution of those many duties which were demanded by the young
lives who looked to her mothering.</p>

<p class='c010'>For some moments Wilder offered no comment. He was concerned,
deeply concerned. This woman’s homely trust and courage affected
him deeply. But more than all else was a superlative thankfulness
that Providence, through George Raymes, had sent him on what had
first looked to be a hopeless pursuit of something completely
impossible of achievement. He remembered the Superintendent’s
final summing up of the work set for him to accomplish.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does it get you?” he had asked, “there it is, a great gold
discovery, somewhere up there on the Hekor, I suppose, and the
mystery of this people filching our trade through a process of
outrageous crime. Somewhere up there there’s a girl-child,
white—she’d be about nineteen or twenty now—lost to the white
world to which she belongs. But above all, from my point of view,
there’s a problem. Who are these Euralians, and what becomes of
the wealth of furs they steal?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole of the work was well-nigh completed. He is had
completely satisfied himself on the problem of the Euralians. He
had recovered the plans of Marty Le Gros’ gold “strike” and it
only remained for him to follow their directions to complete the
re-discovery of the find itself. And now—now he had at length
discovered the “girl-child, white,” who, to his mind was heir to
the things her dead father had left behind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, the end of his task looked to be drawing near, but he
could not resign himself to the fact. Somehow it seemed to him
that he was only approaching the threshold. That the drama of the
whole thing was still in being. That there were scenes yet to be
depicted that would deeply involve him. There was the blind
Japanese man and his panic-stricken woman. There was the terrible
Usak whom he had yet to meet. Then there was The Kid.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid. What was her real name? Felice. Yes. That was the
name Mrs. McLeod had told him. Felice. It meant happiness. It was
a good name. But the irony. Poor child. Raised by the terrible
Usak. Fostered here on the barren lands of the North, without a
hope beyond the hard living these poor folk were able to scrape
with the crude, uncultured assistance of an Indian. The whole
thing was appalling. He loved the Northland. But to be condemned
to it without hope of better things left him wondering at the
amazing courage which Felice and this gentle mother must
possess.</p>

<p class='c010'>In that one brief moment headlong determination came to his
assistance. It was not for nothing that Providence had directed
his steps into this crude, desolate valley. No. And his heart
warmed, and emotions stirred under the gladness of his
inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>He eased himself in his chair and rose abruptly to his
feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mam,” he said, thrusting out a hard brown hand towards
Hesther, “I want to thank you—I—”</p>

<p class='c010'>But the out-held hand dropped abruptly to his side, and he
broke off in the midst of the thing he had to say. For Perse and
Jane Constance had rolled themselves clear of the door-sill to
admit their foster-sister. The Kid stood framed in the opening
with the grey-noon daylight shining behind her. She was radiant
in her mannish parka, and the buckskin trousers terminating in
high moccasins reaching almost to her knees. Her eyes were alight
and shining in their sunbrowned setting, and her fair hair had
fallen from beneath her low-pressed cap. Health and beauty were
in every contour of her vigorous young body, and in her smiling
eyes as she gazed upon the plain, angular face of the man who had
just risen from Hesther’s chair. But a curious shyness left her
hesitating and something dismayed.</p>

<p class='c010'>For one instant the girl’s eyes encountered the man’s. Then
she swiftly glanced at the older woman by the stove. And Hesther
jumped at the cue she felt to be hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s Felice, who we all call the Kid,” she said for the man’s
benefit. Then she turned to the girl. “This is Mr. Wilder, my
dear—Mr. Bill Wilder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s shyness passed in a quick smile that was like a
sudden burst of sunshine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know, Mum, dear,” she cried. “I met him two summers ago on
the river and passed him and his outfit up through the rapids at
the mouth of the river.” Then she crossed over to the man whose
eyes were smiling in perfect content. “You’ve found our little
shanty,” she said holding out a soft brown hand, “and I’m glad.
You’re real welcome.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The frankness of her greeting was utterly without
embarrassment, and Wilder took the outstretched hand in both of
his and held it for a moment while he turned to the mother who
was looking on in amazement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She saved me a two days’ portage, mam,” he said, in
explanation. “And I guess she’s the brightest jewel of a waterman
I’ve seen in years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My!” Hesther’s exclamation was almost a gasp as she watched
their hands fall apart. Then with the mildest shadow of reproach:
“An’ you never told me, Kid, You never said a word.”</p>

    <div>THE GREAT SAVAGE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Usak stood up from the camp fire that was more
than welcome. He stood with his broad back to the shelter of low
scrub to leeward of which the midday camp had been pitched, and
gazed out over a wide expanse of barren, windswept country. The
threat overhanging the grey world was very real. Winter was in
the dense, ponderously moving clouds; it was in the bite of the
northerly wind, which was persistent and found the weak spot in
such human clothing as had not yet given place to the furs of
winter. The light of noonday, too, was sadly dull. For the hidden
sun had lost so much of its summer power, and its range of daily
progress had narrowed down to a line that was low on the
horizon.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the savage was unconcerned for the outlook of the day. He
was unconcerned for the sterile territory over which his long
summer journey had carried him. The man’s whole being was
focussed upon the needs of life. The needs of those who depended
on him. The needs which were no less his own. And for once a
sense of satisfaction, of ease, was all-pervading. His trade had
been something more profitable than it had been for years, and he
understood that the needs of the coming winter, and next year’s
open season, looked like being comfortably provided for. Oh, yes,
there was much labour ahead.</p>

<p class='c010'>His trade must be translated into the simple provisions which
must ultimately be obtained in far-off Placer. He knew all that.
But it left his staunch, fierce spirit unafraid. The means of
obtaining the things needed were in his hands. The rest was the
simple battle with the winter elements which had no terrors for
his unimaginative mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the last lap of a journey of several months. Night
would find him in the shelter of his own home, with the voices of
the white children, who had become so much a part of his life,
ringing in his ears. And before he slept he knew that he would
have witnessed the glad smile of welcome and satisfaction in the
white girl who was as the sun, moon, and stars of his life. He
would have told her of his good news, and together they would
have examined and appraised the values with which he had returned
from the far-off Eskimo camps which good fortune had flung into
his path.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the grey world looked good. Even the naked undulations
amongst which the ribbon-like river wound its way had lost
something of their forbidding aspect. It was the world he knew,
the world he had battled with all his manhood. His satisfaction
had translated it.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood for a moment or two, a figure of splendid manhood.
His far-gazing eyes looked out with something in them akin to
that which looks out of the sailor-man’s eyes. They were
searching, reposeful and steady with quiet confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned at last at the sounds of movement at the fire, and,
for a moment, he watched the white youth, who was his companion,
as he collected the chattels out of which they had taken their
midday meal.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he moved quickly to the boy’s side and took the pan and
camp kettle from his hands. And his actions were accompanied by a
swift protest in a voice that rarely softened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Him Injun work,” he said gruffly. And the manner of it left
no doubt as to the definite understanding of their relations. It
was the man’s fierce pride that his mission was to serve the
white folk entrusted to his care.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clarence yielded, but his thin cheeks flushed. Then he laughed
but without mirth. He was a strapping youth of unusual physique.
At sixteen he was all the man his mother claimed for him, for
somehow the hardship of the trail had eaten into his youthful
character and robbed it of the boyhood his years should have made
his. He was serious, completely serious, and his freckled face
and brown eyes looked something weary of the labour thus early
flung on him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s most always that way, Usak,” he grumbled sharply.
“Nothin’s my work you’ve got time to do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian made no reply. He moved quickly over to the three
great caribou, standing ready for the trail, harnessed to their
long, trailing carryalls. They were fine, powerful bucks,
long-trained to the work, and their widespreading, downy antlers,
now in full growth and almost ready for their annual shedding,
indicated their tally of years in the service of the northern
trail. He bestowed the gear in its allotted place in the outfit
and returned to the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>For a few moments he held out his brown hands to the warming
embers, squatting low on his haunches. Then he turned to the boy.
His reply to the youth’s challenge had been carefully
considered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What you mak him this word?” he said, in his harsh way. “You
my white boss I lak him mak work for. It good. Oh, yes. Someday
it come you grow big white man lak to the good boss, Marty. I
know. Then you think ’em this dam Injun no good. Him mak white
boy-work for him. No good. I, whiteman, no work for Injun man. Oh
no.” His black eyes smiled, and his smile had no more softness in
it than his frown. “I tell you,” he went on. “<em>I</em> think
much big think. You mak big trail man bimeby. Bimeby Usak die
dead. Maybe he get kill ’em all up on winter trail. Who knows?
Then he think much for him Kid. He think much for him
white-mother, Hesther. Him say, Usak all dead. No matter. Him
Clarence big fine trail man. Him mak good all thing Usak no more
do. So Usak not care the big spirit tak him. So. Whiteman tell
Injun all time work. It so. The good boss, Marty, speak so. Injun
man no good, never.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clarence turned quickly. He, too, was squatting over the
welcome fire. A sharp retort was on his lips. He knew that the
Indian was his master on the trail. He knew that the man was
almost superhuman in his ability. He knew that the man’s desire
was just as he said. But somehow the spirit in him refused to
accept the other’s self-abnegation. Usak was his teacher, not his
servant. And somehow he felt there was no right, no justice, for
all the difference in colour, that this creature should so humble
himself by reason of that absurd difference.</p>

<p class='c010'>But his lips closed again without a spoken word. He was held
silent under the sway of the man’s powerful influence. And so, as
it was always, Usak had his way.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a moment the white youth accepted the position thrust on
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We best pull out?” he said almost diffidently.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian nodded. Then his dark eyes smiled again, and his
powerful hands rubbed themselves together over the luxurious
warmth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>I</em> wait for that,” he said quietly. “You my boss. My
good white boss. Same lak the white-girl, Kid, an’ the good
Marty. Sure we pull out. We mak him the farm this night. It good.
Much good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose to his full height without effort, and turned at once
to the waiting caribou.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The night was dark but the burden of cloud had completely
dispersed. In its place was a velvet sky studded with myriads of
starry jewels. Then away to the north the world was lit by a
shadowy movement of northern lights. The night was typical of the
fall of the northern year, chill, still, haunted, for all its
perfect calm, by the fierce threat of the approach of winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ice-cold waters of the river lay behind the outfit. They
had just crossed the shallow ford where the stream played
boisterously over the boulder-strewn gravel bed. The labouring
caribou were moving slowly up the gentle incline of
lichen-covered foreshore. And the Indian on the lead, and the
white youth trailing behind the last of the three beasts of
burden, knew that in less than two hours the last eight miles or
so of their summer-long journey would be accomplished.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak dropped back from his lead and permitted the caribou to
pass him, and took his place beside the leg-weary youth. For some
time they paced on in silence each absorbed in his own
thought.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a great looking forward for both. Both were
contemplating that modest home they were approaching with
feelings of something more than content. Clarence was yearning
for the boisterous companionship of his brothers and sisters. The
boy in him was crying out for the youth which the rigours of the
northern trail had so long denied him. The ramshackle habitation
which was his home possessed for him just now a splendour of
comfort, and ease, and delight such as only a starving
imagination could create about it. He was heart-sick and bodily
weary with the interminable labour which the long trail
demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the Indian it was different. The joy of return for him
had no relation to any weariness of body or spirit. He was
contemplating only the good news which was carefully packed up on
the primitive carryalls to which the caribou were harnessed, and
the happiness he looked to see shining in the eyes of the
whitewoman it was his mission to serve.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was out of this spirit of happy satisfaction he had
abandoned his place at the head of the outfit, and dropped
abreast of his white companion. For once in his life it was his
desire to talk. And the inspiration came from the fulness of his
savage heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The white mother much glad bimeby,” he said, in his curious
halting fashion.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clarence nodded. He paused a moment and ran his strong hands
down the legs of his buckskin nether garments. The ice cold water
of the river was partially squeezed out of them, but they
remained saturated and chilly to the sturdy legs they
covered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure,” he said in brief agreement.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I think much,” Usak went on. “This winter trail. You mak him
with me? Him Kid much good trail man. Plenty big white heart. She
mak ’em good, yes. But she much soft white woman. Winter trail
him hard. Placer long piece far. It no good. No. Clarence big
trail man now. Snow. Ice. Storm. It nothing to big trail man
Clarence—now. You come mak him with Usak? Then him Kid sleep good
by the farm. All time much warm. All time much eat good.
Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy looked up into the darkly shadowed face in the starlit
night as they walked rapidly behind the great deer who were
hurrying towards the homestead which they knew lay ahead. For all
his weariness a great pride uplifted the youth. The desperate
winter trail. The long trail which hitherto had been steadily
denied him by reason of his youth and lacking experience. Usak
had bid him face it. The vanity of the youth flamed up in
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean that, Usak?” he demanded sharply. And the Indian
realised the tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The winter trail for big man,” he said, subtly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Clarence drew a deep breath. Then after a moment he went on.
And again the Indian recognised and approved the new tone that
rang in his voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That goes, Usak,” he said. Then with sudden passionate
energy: “I’m no kid now,” he cried. “The winter trail I guess
needs menfolk, not women or kids. I’m with you, sure. And I play
my hand right through. Say, I go, but I go right. Ther’s goin’ to
be no play. The work that’s yours is yours. The work that’s
mine’s mine. An’ I don’t let any feller do my work on the trail.
Not even you. Does that go? Say it right here an’ now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The smile that changed the Indian’s expression so little was
there under cover of the shadows of night.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Him go all time, sure. You big boss whiteman mak him trade by
Placer. You say all time the thing we do. Oh, yes. That’s so.
Usak—Sho!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man broke off and his final exclamation had in it the
curious hiss so indicative of a mind started profoundly and
unpleasantly. He had halted on the summit of a high ground roller
and stood pointing out ahead, somewhere on the opposite shore of
the river where the twinkling lights of camp fires were burning
brightly. He stood awhile in deep, concentrated contemplation,
and his arm remained out-flung for his companion’s benefit
Clarence, too, was gazing at the amazing sight of the twinkling,
distant camp fires.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same thought was in the mind of each. But it was the
uncompromising spirit of the savage that first gave it
expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Euralian!” he said, in a tone of devastating hatred.</p>

<p class='c010'>Instantly the youth in the other cried out.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mum! She’s alone with the kids!”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder kicked the embers of the fire together. Then he
leant over to the driftwood stack and clawed several sticks from
the pile. He flung them on the fire and watched the stream of
sparks fly upward on the still night air.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the second night of camping on the gravel flats of the
Caribou River, and the last brief hour before seeking the
fur-lined bags in which the northern man is wont to sleep.
Chilcoot and Wilder were squatting side by side, Indian fashion,
over the camp fire burning adjacent to the tent they shared with
the Irishman. And the latter faced them beyond the fire, sprawled
on the ground baked hard by the now departed summer heat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Talk had died out. These men rarely wasted words. They had
long since developed the silent habit which the northern
solitudes so surely breed. But even so, for once there was a
sense of restraint in their silent companionship. It was a
restraint which arose from a sense of grievance on the part of
both Chilcoot and the Irishman. And it had developed from the
moment of quitting the mysterious habitation in the western
hills.</p>

<p class='c010'>The facts were simple enough from their point of view. Both
the Irishman and Chilcoot had been left in complete ignorance of
their leader’s adventures during his long night vigil in the
deserted house. He had returned to them only to order a hurried
departure, and had definitely avoided explanations in response to
their eager inquiries by evasive generalisations.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I just don’t get the meaning of anything, anyway,” he had
declared, with a shake of the head. “Ther’s some queer secret to
that shanty the folks who own it don’t reckon to hand out. If
we’d the time to pass on up the creek maybe we’d locate the
meaning of things. But we haven’t and seemingly that darn house
is empty, and there isn’t a thing to it to tell us anything. No,”
he said, “I’ve passed a long night in it and taken chances I
don’t usually reckon to take, and I’ve quit it feeling like a
feller who’s got through with a nightmare, an’ wonders what in
hell he’s eaten to give it him. I’m sick to death chasing ghosts,
and mean to quit right here. We’ll just need to report to our
superiors,” he smiled, “an’ leave ’em to investigate. Meanwhile
we’ll get right on after the stuff which seems to me to lie in
one direction, and that’s the location where the dead missioner
worked around. We’ll beat it down to the Caribou River for a last
fling, and after that Placer’s the best thing I know.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot who understood his friend through long years of
experience and association was by no means deceived. But his
loyalty was the strongest part of him. He read behind the man’s
words. He saw and appreciated the suggestion of excitement lying
at the back of Wilder’s smiling eyes, and understood that the
claimed unproductiveness of the night’s vigil was sheer
subterfuge. Furthermore he realised that the hurriedly ordered
departure had been inspired by the events of the night. But he
attempted no further question. And even aided his friend in
denying the torrent of questioning which the Irishman did not
scruple to pour out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mike’s reminders of the obvious oil and coal wealth of the
black, mysterious hills, and the queer soil of the whole region,
left Wilder unmoved. He agreed simply. But he dismissed the whole
proposition as being outside anything but the range of their
natural curiosity. He reminded the persistent creature that the
territory was Alaskan, and they were for the time being debarred
from further investigation through being enrolled officers of the
Canadian Police.</p>

<p class='c010'>So he had had his way and the eastward journey was embarked
upon. And as the waters of the oily creek passed away behind
them, and the queer Fire Hills dropped back into the distance he
hugged his secrets of the night to himself for the purpose of
using them in the fashion he had already designed. Thus his
companions were left puzzled and dissatisfied.</p>

<p class='c010'>All the way down the great waterway of the Hekor, Wilder had
pondered the position in which he found himself and the events
which had led up to it. The figures of the blinded Japanese and
his little wife haunted him. Then there was that carefully
detailed chart which showed the locality of the dead missionary’s
discovery to be on the Caribou River. And the thought of the
Caribou had brought again into the forefront of his vision the
memory of the fair young white girl who had passed him up the
rapids which churned about its mouth, and with her parting
farewell, had flung her invitation at him to that home which was
ten miles up from the junction of the two rivers.</p>

<p class='c010'>The memory of the Kid had been with him ever since he had
first gazed down into her wonderful blue eyes, and had realised
the perfect rounded figure of her womanhood under her mannish
garb. He had always remembered those peeping golden strands of
hair, which, despite her best effort to conceal them, never
failed to escape from under the fur cap which was so closely
drawn down over her shapely head. Then her wonderful skill on the
water, her confidence and her pride in her achievement. He needed
nothing beyond those things. The girl had held him fascinated.
She had set all the youth in him afire. And now—now the wonder of
it. The chances of those remote hills had sent him racing down
towards her home full of a dream that surged through his senses
with all the pristine fire of his hitherto unstirred manhood.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was thinking of her now. He was thinking of his visit to
her home that very noonday, the first of his arrival upon the
river. As he sat over the fire silently contemplating the depth
of its ruddy heart with calm unsmiling eyes, a passionate desire
was stirring within him. Since the moment of return to his camp
on the gravel flats, with the picture of that happy, unkempt home
full of sturdy young life haunting him, he had been concerned
only for the sweet, blue, smiling eyes of the girl of the
northern wild.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had heard the story of the courageous mother. He had heard
the girl’s story from her own pretty lips as they had walked, to
the bank of the river where he had left his canoe moored. And he
had been filled with only the greater admiration for the simple
strength and courage with which these devoted souls had embarked
upon their tremendous struggle for existence.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he knocked out his charred pipe and thrust it away
into a pocket. Again his hands were outspread to the blaze, but
now his eyes were directed to the red-headed creature beyond the
fire. Wilder suddenly cleared his throat. He began to speak,
addressing himself to the Irishman. And Chilcoot looked round
from his contemplation of the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You boys best listen awhile while I make a talk.” Wilder’s
manner was quiet enough, but there was that in his tone which
impressed his companions. “You’ve maybe both got a grouch on me.
And I’ll admit I’d feel the same if I were you. You’re both of
you guessing all sorts of bad med’cine about that business back
there in the hills. You’re reckoning I got visions I haven’t
figured to pass on to you. Well, I sort of feel like clearing
things up some—I mean that old grouch.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His eyes began to smile and he turned to the older man beside
him and shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he went on, “I’m not going to say a word about that
night I passed in that darn place. I’m just going to ask you boys
to sort of forget it, and forget your grouch. You just got to
trust me same as you’ve done right along, and maybe later, I’ll
be able to hand you the story as I know it. You, Chilcoot, know
me, and I guess you’ll act that way without a kick. It’ll be
harder for Mike, who hasn’t worked with me the years you have.
Still, maybe I can make it easy even for him.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He thrust out a foot and kicked the fire together while the
two men maintained their silent regard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The thing I’ve to talk about is the thing we got to do right
here,” he went on. “I’ve got it planned, and I want to hand you
the schedule of it. We’ve drawn a bad run of blanks for the stuff
we’ve been chasing for the past year, but the run’s ended. The
stuff’s in sight. It’s right here on these mud flats, for all the
notion’ll seem plumb crazy to you boys.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman stirred and sat up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ther’s gold on this darn—creek?” he cried incredulously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There surely is.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s tone had suddenly hardened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How’d you know that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Quick as a flash came the red-headed man’s question.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s eyes responded coldly to the challenge. He shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ther’s no reason for me to hand you that, Mike,” he said
sharply. “Ther’s no reason for me to hand you a word that way.
You signed a partnership in this layout, with me to lead without
question. The thing that concerns you is the stuff. Here. You
don’t believe that stuff is on this creek. That’s so. I say it
is. Our partnership doesn’t quit till fall next year. Well, I
guess I’m not yearning to hand you presents. Guess you haven’t
found it my way—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mike grinned as he punctuated the other’s remark.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just so,” Wilder nodded. “That being so it’ll make you
appreciate the thing I’ll hand you now. I’ll pass you a bank
draft for haf a million dollars the day we set foot in Placer if
we haven’t located that missioner’s ‘strike’ somewhere along this
mud-bottomed creek. An’ I’ll call Chilcoot to witness that
goes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The two men gazed eye to eye through the haze of smoke. Mike
made no movement, but a look of almost foolish doubt was in his
mute regard of the man who made his amazing offer. It was
different with Chilcoot. He turned almost with a jump.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, you’re crazy, Bill,” he protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not,” Wilder snapped, while his gaze remained steadily
fixed on the face of the man beyond the fire. “Does it go, Mike?”
he asked. “And does it cut out your kick? That’s the thing I’m
looking for. You get the thing we’re looking for under my
leadership, or I hand you haf a million dollars a present.
Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman raised a hand and thrust his fur cap back from
his forehead. His amazement was almost ludicrous.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Chilcoot’s right,” he blurted at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He isn’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You—mean that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman suddenly broke into a laugh of derision. “Well,”
he cried, “Chilcoot’s witness.” Then he flung up his hands. “Say,
I haven’t any sort of kick left in me. I don’t care a curse if
you passed the night in that darnation shanty with an army of
murderin’ spooks. Gee! Haf a million dollars. I’d hate to death a
sight of that missioner’s ‘strike’ between now an’ next fall.
Hand out your dope, Bill. You’re boss of this layout. Haf a
million! Gee!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded. He turned at once to Chilcoot. He shook his
head with quiet confidence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m not crazy, boy,” he cried, in a tone of pleasant
tolerance. “Do you mind our ‘strike’ back there on Eighty-mile in
those days when we were worried keeping our bellies from rattling
against our backbones? Get a look into this darn swamp and think
back. It’s twin to Eighty-mile. The formation is like as two
beans. The same mud, an’ granite, with the same queer breaks of
red gravel miles on a stretch. Ther’s that. But ther’s more. That
missioner lived right on this creek. It was his home country. And
he wasn’t the boy to chase around on a prospect. If he made a
‘strike’ it was on home territory that was always under his eye.
And you’ll mind he never mentioned Caribou in his yarns. He said
Loon Creek, which is far enough to keep prying eyes from getting
around the real location. Maybe he was wise for all they beat
him. There it is anyway. I’ve got a mighty hunch for this
creek.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned again to the fire, and thrust out his hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ you reckon to stake a haf million on your notion?”
Chilcoot cried uneasily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’ll play my luck.” Wilder nodded. “I’ll go further. I know
the stuff is here.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know that?” Mike broke in.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I surely do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You reckon you ken set your finger on it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“More or less.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man with the flaming head suddenly sprang to his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>“More or—less!” he cried almost contemptuously in his headlong
way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder remained unmoved.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here,” he said quietly spreading out his hand in an
expressive gesture, “we only got a matter of weeks to the
freeze-up. We’re liable to snow any day now, and every night
ther’s frost. In awhile the ground’ll be solid so we can’t break
into it without more dynamite than we got stowed. That being so,
here’s the schedule. You, Mike, now you feel good about it, ’ll
need to beat up stream and locate prospect ground for next
spring. You’ll use the whole outfit and you’ll locate camp
ground. That’s your billet till the freeze-up, and you’ll need to
make right up to the head waters. Chilcoot and I’ll beat our own
trail. An’ don’t forget it, boy, Chilcoot’s witness ther’s haf a
million for you if we don’t make that ‘strike.’ Does it tickle
you any?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just plumb to death, chief.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman was grinning from the roots of his flaming hair
to a neck that was none too clean. The last shadow of his
discontent had vanished from his expressive eyes. And even
Chilcoot was smiling in his slow fashion.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s good,” said Wilder. “Guess we can roll into our—Hello!
What the—?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He sat peering out down the river bank with a hand shading his
eyes from the firelight. Chilcoot too had turned searching into
the night. The Irishman, standing, was in possession of the
better view.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s two fellers comin’ up from the river,” he said. “An’
they got a small kyak drawn up on the shore.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The gathering about Wilder’s camp fire had been augmented.
Five men sat about it where before there had only been three. Of
the newcomers one was a white youth and the other was an Indian,
who left Wilder’s stature no more than ordinary. The newcomers
were squatting on the river side of the fire, slightly apart from
the others. And they sat side by side, closely, as though there
remained a definite barrier of antagonism between them and the
strangers they had found on the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak sat with his long old rifle laid across his knees.
Clarence was armed, too, but his weapon was in the nature of a
more modern sporting rifle. Of the gold men one at least realised
the personality of these visitors in the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>There had been no greeting. The Indian and his companion had
approached watchfully. They had reached the fire without a word.
But their eyes had been busy, and their minds full of searching
questions. Forthwith they had squatted. But only on their
recognition that their hosts were whitemen.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Wilder who broke up the strained silence. The moment
the flame of fire had lit up the white youth’s face recognition
had been instant. The likeness in it to the faces of those
brothers and sisters he had encountered that noonday left the
identity of both him and his dusky companion beyond question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You are Clarence,” he said, with quiet friendliness. Then his
gaze rested thoughtfully upon the inscrutable eyes, and harshly
moulded features of the Indian. “And you are Usak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the white youth who replied. He nodded while the Indian
sat searching the whitemen’s faces with a gaze that was almost
lost in eyes narrowed down to the merest slits.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gold men on the trail. My name’s Wilder. Bill Wilder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian raised one arm and indicated the others.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Him men, too? What you call ’em?”</p>

<p class='c010'>His young white boss having answered the first question Usak
had no scruple but to take up the rest of the matter himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Chilcoot Massy and Red Mike Partners with me. And we come
from Placer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s ready reply was in studied friendliness. But his keen
eyes searched the Indian’s face, which was completely
expressionless. The dusky face had neither friendliness nor
antagonism. Yet it was potential for either under the harsh mask
which Nature had set upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot and Mike left the situation in the hands of their
chief, and simply sat waiting and curious. The white boy afforded
them little concern. It was the Indian, with his grim manner, and
his long, old-fashioned rifle that claimed their whole attention,
as it did their chief’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Wilder was studying the man out of his knowledge of his
malevolent reputation. He knew he was confronting the dreaded
creature who had perpetrated his terrible vengeance upon those
two people he had encountered at the house in the hills. He knew
it at once when he recognised Clarence as one of the family he
had visited that noonday. And he was anxious to discover the
impression his presence on the river made upon the man.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had not long to wait.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You gold men,” Usak said, in a tone that was deep-throated
and full of the latent savage in him. “You come for gold? You
come to Caribou.” He shook his head, and his eyes suddenly opened
wide, and their black depths were full of that fierce resentment
which was to be feared like a cyclonic storm. “I tell you no!” he
cried hotly. “Caribou is not for whiteman gold man. No. It is for
the white girl the good boss Marty leave to the care of Usak. Him
all mans quit Caribou quick. I say him. I—Usak. You’m go quick
as you come. You not go, then all mans get kill up dead. It so.
Him no gold on Caribou, an’ Caribou him for my good white-girl
boss, Kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With his last word the man stood erect and his movement was
without any apparent effort. He stood a creature of mighty
stature grasping a long rifle that was dwarfed beside him. He
deliberately spat in the fire and turned away. Then it was, for
the first time, he experienced the authority he had forced on his
white companion’s shoulders. Clarence, too, had risen, but he did
not turn away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, Usak, just stop right here,” he ordered sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian was startled. He turned again and waited at the
boy’s bidding, while his passionate eyes narrowed on the
instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clarence gave him no time to speak. He passed round the fire
to Wilder and thrust out a welcoming hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m glad to meet you, sir,” he said, with an amiable boyish
smile. “Guess <em>I’m</em> only a kid, but I can speak for my
mother an’ the Kid. You see, Usak’s our guardian around here.
He’s the best thing to us that was ever put into an Indian’s
body. But he reckons this river and all the territory around it
belongs to my mother an’ the Kid, an’ hates the sight of folks he
thinks likely to do us hurt. You get that? But he don’t quite
understand things between whitefolk. I’m glad to welcome you to
our country, an’ I’ll be glad to welcome you by our home down the
river. And I guess Mum, and the Kid’ll feel that way, too. Maybe
you’ll forget Usak spat into your fire.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder took the boy’s hand in a powerful grip, and smiled up
into his ingenuous tired face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why, sure,” he cried. “You don’t need to say another word.
I’ve been along this morning to pay my respects to your splendid
mother, and your—Kid. And seeing I’m located on this river of
yours for the next year, why, I’m hoping I’ll see a deal of you
all. My friends here feel that way, too. We’re not pirates come
to steal anything you reckon is yours, or to hand you a moment’s
worry. That goes, an’ I guess your mother’ll tell you the
same.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy stood for a moment a little overwhelmed by the easy,
friendly manner of the stranger. And in his confusion at his
impulsive assertion of authority over the Indian he resorted to
the only thing his wit suggested. He took refuge in a swift
withdrawal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thank you, sir,” he said lamely. “I guess we’ll get right on
home. You see, we’re just in off a summer trail.” He turned away
and looked squarely into the Indian’s face. “We’ll beat it home,
Usak,” he said shortly.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>They watched the shadowy figures in silence as they passed
down the river bank and were swallowed up by the shadows of the
chilly night.</p>

<p class='c010'>Red Mike turned and grinned at his companions through the haze
of smoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That boy’s chock full of real sand,” he said with
appreciation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot rubbed his gnarled hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d sooner be up against the worst Euralian ever bred than
that darn redskin,” he said meditatively.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded and extended his hands over the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he said, regarding the fire with serious eyes. “Or a
whole darn legion of ’em.”</p>

    <div>DAYS OF PROMISE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The Kid stood up from her task. She was no longer
in her working clothes, and the translation was something almost
magical. Her tall, slim, yet beautifully rounded figure was clad
in a simple shirtwaist of some cheap cotton material, which, with
a plain, dark cloth, shortish skirt, completed the costume in
which she loved to array herself at the close of her working day.
She was smiling her delight, and her whole expression was
radiant. Her pretty eyes were alight with all that satisfaction
which Usak, in his simple mind, had dreamt he would witness in
them. Her lips were parted for the eager talk which sprang so
readily to them. And as the brooding eyes of the savage gazed
upon her he felt that his reward was ample.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were in the leanto storehouse built against the log
shanty which was Usak’s own abode. It was all a part of the
ramshackle homestead which housed them all, but it was set apart
and without communication with the abode given up to the white
folks of the queerly assorted household.</p>

<p class='c010'>An oil lamp lit the place with its inadequate yellow light,
and produced profound shadows amongst the general litter. It was
set on an up-turned packing case which was part of the
stock-in-trade for transport. The dry mud floor was littered with
the result of the Indian’s summer trade, the extent and quality
of which was far more generous than the girl had hoped would be
the case. There were a number of pelts amongst which were several
white and red fox. There were two or three freshwater seals, some
beaver and fishers, and a makeweight of wild cat. But best of all
were several ivory walrus tusks, and the prize of all prizes to
the pelt hunter, which the girl was holding in her brown hands
and stroking gently in her delight. It was a jet black fox. And
she knew its value to be far more than the rest of the trade put
together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a wonderful, wonderful skin, Usak,” she said, her eyes
feasting on the crudely dried fur, which, even in its rough state
was still soft, and thick, and full of promise. “Whoever took it
was a swell hunter,” she declared, scrutinising it with the eye
of an expert. “Trapped. And not a scar to show how. My, but it’s
worth a pile. How much?”</p>

<p class='c010'>She raised her delighted eyes to the dark face of the big man
standing by.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sho!” The Indian shrugged. “I not say him. Tousand dollar,
maybe. Him much plenty good pelt. Oh, yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thousand?” The girl’s tone was scornful. “More like fifteen
hundred. We’ll get that in Placer, sure. An’ these ivories,” she
went on. “Oh, it’s a good trade.” She laid the skin aside
reluctantly and smiled again into the man’s face. “Guess if I
know a thing we haven’t a worry for a year an’ more. Mum’ll sleep
easy for a year certain, I guess. An’ Perse’s pants won’t always
have her figgering.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then the woman in her became uppermost as she contemplated the
further meaning of the Indian’s success.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mum’ll get a new outfit. And so will Mary Justicia. An’ we
can fix up all the others, the boys as well, I mean. It’s just
great, Usak. You’re—you’re a wonder. How did you do it? Did you
locate a bunch of Euralian robbers, an’—”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian shook his head. But he offered no verbal denial.
Truth to tell the girl’s curiosity and obvious desire for the
story of his summer-long labours made no appeal to him. For all
his satisfaction at the Kid’s readily expressed delight he had
been robbed of more than half his joy of return by that final
incident of his journey home. His passionate heart was full of a
sort of crazy resentment at the presence of the outfit of white
intruders on the river. And even as the girl talked and
questioned he remained absorbed in, and nursing his bitter
grievance.</p>

<p class='c010'>His silence and lack of interest were too painfully obvious to
be missed. And the Kid suddenly dropped to a seat on a box beside
the beautiful fur she had laid aside.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, Usak?” she asked, with that quick return to the
authority which existed between them. “Ther’s things worrying. I
can see it in your face. Best tell it right away. Is it Clarence?
Has he failed after the good things you hoped of him? Yes. Best
tell it. I can stand things to-night with a clean up of trade
like this around me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian moved away. He squatted himself on an upturned sled
awaiting repairs to its runners. And the girl watched him
closely.</p>

<p class='c010'>Young as she was there was much that the Kid understood
instinctively. She had not spent all her childhood’s days with
this great savage without learning something of his almost
insanely passionate moods, and the potentialities of them. To her
he was just a savage watch-dog, loyal from the crown of his black
head to the soles of his moccasined feet. But she understood that
his curious ferocity was none the less for it. There was one
thing in him that never failed to stir her to some alarm. It was
the narrowing of his black eyes, which, in his more violent
moods, had a knack of closing to mere slits. His eyes were so
closed just now.</p>

<p class='c010'>While she waited for him to speak she watched him reach out
and possess himself of his beloved rifle which had been stood
against the wall of the leanto. He took it, and laid it across
his knees, and his powerful fingers caressed the quaint old
trigger-guard. It seemed to her that never in her life had she
observed him in so ominous a mood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?” she demanded sharply, and her alarm added a strident
ring to her voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man looked up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mak him this question?” he demanded, without softening.
“This thing I mak to myself. Oh, yes. It for me. I feel him all
here,” he beat his chest with one clenched fist to indicate his
bosom. “I mak him no say. Not nothing. Clarence him big whiteman.
Much good trail man. So. I mak you big trade. Plenty food come
next year. Plenty good thing much. So. You lak him? Oh, yes. It
good. Then why you mak him this question?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s jaws seemed literally to shut with a snap.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid smiled with an effort. She was without personal fear.
Her smiling blue eyes confronted and held him as she determined
they should.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m waiting,” she said. “If I wait here all night in the cold
you’ll surely have to say it. What’s troubling?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s power over the savage was tremendous. In a curious
negative sort of way she understood that this was so. She never
looked for the reason, simply accepting the obvious fact, and
sometimes rejoicing in it.</p>

<p class='c010'>For all her youth she understood the danger of his untamed
spirit. And many times in her young life she had learned the
value of the restraining influence she exercised over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man knew his weakness in confronting her. There were times
when his hot soul rebelled at his own powerlessness. It was that
way now. But through it all a subtle gladness never failed to
soften the irritation their clashes of will were wont to inspire.
The truth was his utter and complete worship of her was
irresistible. As an infant the Kid had caught the rebound of his
devotion to his murdered wife, Pri-loo, and the perfect loyalty
that had been his for her father. From the moment of the passing
of these two creatures, who had bounded the whole of his life’s
horizon, he had found salvation from the wreckage of his savage
passions in the infant life that had been flung into his empty
arms. Perhaps his worship of her was a sheer insanity. But it was
an idolatry of parental purity.</p>

<p class='c010'>He chafed under her insistence. Once he sought to avoid those
compelling eyes. He gazed about among the shadows of the hut in a
helpless fashion that was almost pathetic, whilst his great hand
fondled the breech of his beloved weapon. But he returned to the
magnet that never failed to claim him as surely held as any
bond-slave.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tcha!” The exclamation was the man’s final, ungracious
yielding. He flung his rifle aside and stood up. And in a moment
he was rapidly pacing the narrow limits of the hut. “You ask him
this? I tell you, ‘no.’ No good. So I tell you.” He paused and
flung out an arm pointing in the direction of the river. “This
white-man. Bimeby I go kill ’em all up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He remained pointing. His eyes were wide now and full of
deadly purpose. A volcanic rage was consuming him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid’s eyes also widened for an instant. She remained
unmoving. Then a smile dawned about her lips and presently
illuminated her whole face. She raised one hand and thrust out a
pointing finger at him, and a clear, happy, ringing laugh broke
from her parted lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You kill up these whitemen?” she cried. “These folks who’ve
just come along up the river? No,” she said, suddenly sobering,
and shaking her head. “If you kill them you kill me, too. They’re
all my good friends, Usak. An’ if you hurt a hair of their heads
I’ll just hate you to death for ever an’ ever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a tense moment. The man had come to a standstill,
staring incredulously down at the fair-haired creature who was
his whole earthly delight. For all her laugh there was fear in
the Kid’s heart. The impulse had been irresistible. There could
be no half measures. The situation had called for strong and
definite challenge.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You say him this?” The man’s tone was like the threatening
growl of a wild beast. “This whitemans all your good friend? I
tell you—No! Him mans your enemy. Him come steal all things what
are yours. Him river. Him land. Him—gold. Usak know plenty much.
Him no damfool Injun man. Oh, no. Him wise plenty. Him say this
whitemans no good friend. Only big thief come steal all thing. So
I kill ’em up, sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid breathed a deep sigh. The joy of this wild man’s
return had lost its glamour. Deepening fear gripped her heart.
And it was for the whiteman with the grey eyes that smiled so
gently, and reflected so clearly the big, honest soul behind
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You just got to listen, Usak,” she cried urgently, stifling
the fear which was striving to display itself in eye and voice.
“An’ when I’ve done my talk you’ll need to quit that wicked
spirit that’s always wanting to kill when folks offend you. I
didn’t know you’d had time to locate these folks. But it don’t
matter a thing. I tell you they’re friends—of mine. I’ve known
Bill Wilder since two summers back. I found him in trouble with
his outfit on the river below the rapids, and passed him right up
through the channel on his way north. And I asked him right then,
when he got along down, to come up the Caribou an’ make a
friendly visit. He’s come along because I asked him. He’s my
friend an’—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You lak him, this man? Him your man? You marry him same lak
Pri-loo was my woman?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s tone had changed to one of simple wonder and almost
of incredulity. His understanding had only one interpretation for
a man and woman’s friendship, and perhaps he was the wiser for
it. But his savage, untutored directness of expression sent the
hot blood of shame to the simple girl’s cheeks. The yellow
lamp-light revealed the flushed cheeks and the half closed
eyelids that sought to defend the woman’s secret from the man’s
searching gaze.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid shook her head, and denial cost her an effort. “It’s
not that way with white-folk,” she said endeavouring to evade
direct denial. “Maybe I just like him. He’s big, an’ strong, an’
good. I like his talk. So I think Mum an’ the children like him,
too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you say this man to come by Caribou—that you see him some
more? Oh, yes. So white mother Hesther may lak him, too? An’
those others?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s eyes were no longer fierce. They were smiling
derisively out of his savage wisdom.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid stirred restlessly under his words and manner. His
smile, which was intended for no unkindness, became a hateful
thing to her. And she understood the reason. She knew that her
explanation was without truth. She had trapped herself into
foolish evasion. She knew she had desired herself to see this man
again. She knew— But she permitted herself no further admission.
Anger rose swiftly in her, and she sprang to her feet. Her pretty
eyes flashed in the yellow light and for the first time in his
life the Indian realised something of that which centuries of
civilization has bred into the white-woman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How dare you say that to me?” she cried. “You—an Indian!” She
laughed a curious shrill sort of laugh. “What is it you say?
‘Injun man no good.’ Maybe you’re right. I’m your good boss
Marty’s daughter. Remember that. I’m your boss. Your white boss.
And now I tell you to obey. You leave that whiteman, all those
whitemen alone. I tell you this. Who’re you to say who comes on
this river? Who’re you anyway? Usak, the Indian. An Indian—the
servant of my dead father, and now my servant. Remember!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She stood in the fitful light a tall slim figure of angry
authority and outraged womanhood. And the great Indian stood
cowed before the torrent of her scorn and wrath. No longer was
the smiling derision in his eyes. No longer was that blaze of
volcanic wrath in them. She had smote him in the most vulnerable
joint of his armour. His worshipped idol had turned and rended
him, and spurned him as she might some pariah.</p>

<p class='c010'>The great fellow’s eyes avoided the girl’s. His simian length
of arms left his great hands hanging seemingly helpless by his
sidies. His great size reduced him to a painful picture of
pathetic dejection. The Kid’s swift scorn had beaten him as
nothing else in the world could have beaten him.</p>

<p class='c010'>She moved towards the door without a further glance in his
direction. Her body was erect, and her heart was hard set and
coldly determined. There was no pause or further word. But she
knew.</p>

<p class='c010'>It came as she reached the door. There was a sound behind her.
The next moment Usak was beside her holding out the precious
black fox skin she had left.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You tak him this?” he said, in a tone of humility and appeal
that was irresistible to the girl who knew so well all he had
always been to her. “I mak him this trade for the white boss,
Kid. I see ’em five Euralian by the camp. I kill ’em all up dead.
So I mak tak ’em this black fox, an’ this ivory. Oh, yes. I kill
’em all man’s for white boss, Kid. All time I do this. I do all
thing for Kid. So as she say—all time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl looked up into the man’s dark eyes. In a moment her
heart melted. She took the priceless skin from his hands and laid
it over her arm with one hand resting caressingly upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You killed five Euralian men for this?” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I kill ’em, yes,” the man returned simply.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl shook her head, and her eyes were troubled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I—I kind of wish you hadn’t,” she said gently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Euralian?” The man’s eyes widened. “It not matter nothing,”
he said, with a shrug. “So I get him skin an’ him ivory for white
boss, Kid. I kill all thing. Yes.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The two men were standing on a gravel foreshore. It was the
foreshore of a well-nigh dried out creek which in more abundant
season was wont to flow turbulently into the greater stream of
the Caribou. It was an almost hidden creek, for there existed no
apparent inlet to the bigger river, except at such times as the
spring freshet translated it into a surge of flood water. Now, in
the late fall, there was scarcely water enough in its bed to do
more than moisten the soles of a man’s moccasins, and, at the
junction with Caribou, there was scarcely an indentation in the
latter’s banks to mark its course.</p>

<p class='c010'>But a mile and more to the north it was quite different. Here
the creek was sharply marked between high, wide, barren shoulders
that gave its course a breadth of something little less than a
quarter of a mile. And its whole bed was a curious, copper-hued
gravel which every gold man recognises as the precious
“pay-dirt,” in pursuit of which he spends his life.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder and Chilcoot were moving slowly over this loose
gravel gazing searchingly at the higher ground which enclosed the
deepening cutting. For the moment they had no concern for the
stuff they were treading under foot. They were looking for signs
and landmarks which they had already learned by heart from minute
descriptions.</p>

<p class='c010'>With every furlong they explored the encompassing walls rose
steadily higher, and grew ever more and more rugged. Their
formation was rapidly changing. The rock walls were cut with
sharp facets and riven in a hundred directions. There was no
foliage anywhere. The cliffs were bald and not a yard of the wide
pay-dirt bottom yielded a scrag of grass, or a single Arctic
flower. It looked as if Nature had refused one atom of fertility
to the soil in which she had chosen to bestow her treasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was nearly noon when the explorers’ investigations were
first interrupted. And the interruption came at a low headland
where the whole course of the ravine swung away in an easterly
direction, which looked to carry it in an exact parallel with the
upper waters of the Caribou.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot was on the lead at the bend and he came to a
standstill, and flung out an arm pointing.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get a look, Bill,” he cried, in the rough tone that for him
was something indicative of the unusual. “It’s a shanty, or I’m a
‘dead-beat.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>The ravine had narrowed abruptly, but beyond the bend it
instantly widened. Chilcoot was standing gazing beyond, where the
dark, rocky walls had risen to a great height and overhung,
shadowing the canyon ominously. He was pointing across the almost
dried out stream at a tiny human habitation crushed in against
the base of the opposite wall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder instantly abandoned his pre-occupation with a curious
facet of black rock that was not unlike pumice in its queer
formation. He had been examining a vein of crystal quartz running
through it. He hurried up to his companion and gazed at the
strange vision of a log-built shack that seemed a complete
anachronism in this wilderness of Nature.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Wilder gazed about him. The interior of the dilapidated hut
was no less interesting than its exterior. It was old and
decayed, hanging together simply by reason of the support of the
cliff against which it had been built. For the moment imagination
was stirred, and he saw in fancy the picture of a simple
missionary carrying on, in his untutored fashion, a work that had
no relation to his spiritual calling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot, with the practical interest which the discovery
inspired in his lesser imagination, was examining the signs and
indications with which the place was littered. There was a
rusted, riffled pan. There were several shovels in a more or less
state of decay. There was an old packing case filled with odds
and ends for a camper’s needs. There were the remains of a fire
set between two blackened stones, a battered camp kettle and a
pannikin or two. Just within the doorway stood a bent crowbar and
a haftless pick. Another pick was leaning up against the box of
oddments.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was easy enough to interpret the story of this decayed and
deserted shelter. And the men who had discovered it were prompt
in their reading of its story. It was a gold prospector’s shelter
littered with the crudest implements of his craft. And from the
decaying walls and rafters, and the rust-eaten condition of every
metal utensil, they read a story of long years of disuse and the
stress of the northern seasons.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot was stooping over the box of camp rubbish. Wilder had
turned to the doorway, leaning out of its original truth, and,
for awhile, the scene beyond it completely preoccupied him. It
was a shadowed canyon which, as the distance gained, grew more
and more rugged with vastly higher surroundings. But the gravel
bed remained with its tiny stream of water drifting gently down
from its far-off source. Directly opposite him stood a spire of
rock that rose up like a monolith far above all its surroundings,
and the sight of it seemed to absorb all his interest.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sharp exclamation from Chilcoot startled him and he turned
his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What you found?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot was standing over the box and its contents were
littered about him on the ground. He was peering into a rusted
tin box, stirring the contents with a knotted forefinger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dust,” he replied laconically. But his tone was tense.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill came quickly to his side and together they gazed down at
the loose yellow stuff that shone dully against the red rust with
which the years had corroded the tin containing it. In spite of
their years, their wealth, the sight of the precious metal held
them fascinated, and stirred emotions deeply. It was a generous
sample weighing several ounces, and amongst it were two or three
nuggets the size of well-grown peas. Chilcoot picked out the
largest and held it up for his companion’s inspection.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded, but his eyes were shining.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure,” he said. Then he turned away. “Set it aside, old
friend,” he went on, “an’ let’s get outside. We need to
talk.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The sky was drearily overcast, and the walls of the canyon
further helped to overshadow the world about them. The two men
were lounging on the bare gravel which formed the bed of the
creek. Wilder had his back propped against the crazy shanty they
had just explored.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot folded up the paper which the other had passed him
for examination. It was the plan of Marty Le Gros’ gold “strike,”
and it was the first time since it had come into Wilder’s
possession that other eyes than his had been permitted to gaze
upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The older man returned it without comment, but his deepset
grey eyes were expressive. There was puzzlement in them. There
was something else. They had narrowed curiously. And the hard
lines of his weatherbeaten face were a shade more hardly set.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder returned the map to the bosom of his buckskin parka. He
flaked some tobacco from a plug with his sheath knife and lit his
pipe. He ignored his companion’s mood, although perfectly aware
of it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ther’s a deal to do yet,” he said calmly. “A piece farther up
the creek is Le Gros’ old working. The map shows that just as it
hands us a picture of this shanty, and that queer spire of rock
standing up right over there,” he added, nodding his head at the
curious crag which rose sheer from the bed of the creek and
towered above the high walls enclosing it. “Yes, we got to
prospect that working, and try out the creek right along. If the
‘strike’ is right, and the old yarn proves true, the rest’s
easy—or should be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot lit his pipe. But he shook his head emphatically.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess I can’t hand no sort of opinion,” he said coldly. “I
ain’t wise to a thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The tone of voice, the curtness of the thing he said, should
have had their effect. But Wilder still refused to be disturbed
out of his calm. His eyes smiled as he gazed out over the gravel
bed where the thin stream of the creek flowed on almost without a
murmur. He was smoking with that leisurely luxury suggesting a
contented mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just so, old friend,” he replied. “You don’t know a
thing—yet. But you’re going to know it right now. All of it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m glad.” The asperity was still in the other’s tone and
Wilder’s smile deepened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see I hadn’t the nerve to insult your intelligence, boy,
by handing you a fairy tale—while it was just a fairy tale,” he
said. “Guess I can’t stand the laff when it’s on me, either. So I
guessed I best cut the talk and stand for a grouch. Well, it’s
not a fairy tale now. No. Not by a long piece. An’ the laff—well,
it’s not on me anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot had sat up. His sturdy legs were drawn up and tucked
under him in the fashion supposed to belong to the tailor. He was
gazing round on his friend with a look of expectancy. Somehow his
whole expression had undergone a swift change. He had clearly
forgotten his resentment. He was always quick to react. His
nature was easy where Wilder was concerned. Now a twinge of
compunction at his own hastiness set him eager to make
amends.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You don’t need to say a thing, Bill. If it suits you to keep
your face shut it goes with me all the time.”</p>

<p class='c010'>But Wilder shook his head. He grinned and raised a hand and
thrust back his cap.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I need to say a whole heap. Maybe when I’m through you’ll
wish I hadn’t. Say.” He paused thoughtfully. Then his eyes lit
and gazed straight into the eyes of the older man. “I best tell
you the thing that lies back of everything first. You’ll feel
like laffing, maybe. But I don’t care a curse. You got to know,
an’ I’m crazy to tell you. You see, you’ve been pardner an’
friend to me ever since the gold bug got into my liver. I’m nigh
crazy for a pair of dandy blue eyes, just as blue as—as a summer
sky in California, and a golden halo of hair like—like an
angel’s. Yes, an’ for a kit of buckskin, all beaded an’ fine sewn
like an Indian’s. I surely am crazy for it—all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man had removed his pipe, and his hands had made a gesture
of emphasis that told his companion far more than his words.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot’s eyes were grinning, but there was no derision in
them. They were shining with a depth of interest that changed his
whole expression.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Snakes, man!” he cried. “You’ve fallen fer that gal? That Kid
that floated us up the river goin’ north? An’ who you’ve located
again right now over at that darn queer outfit of a Reindeer
farm? Say!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded and returned his pipe to his mouth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I surely have, old friend,” he said, with a restraint that
the look in his eyes denied. “I’ve fallen fer that—Kid. That Kid
whose name is Felice Le Gros. She’s just been a dream picture to
me ever since I saw her handling that queer skin kyak of hers on
the river, looking like some fairy Injun gal such as maybe you
used to read about when story books were filled with wholesome
fairy tales that set you crazy for the darn old wilderness. I’ve
fallen for her so I don’t even want to pick myself up. I want her
bad. She’s got to be my wife, or this darn life don’t mean a
thing to me ever again. Life? Gee! I can’t see a day of it worth
a regret on a deathbed if I can’t make that Kid feel the way I
do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot’s ill mood was entirely swept away. Hard old citizen
as he was, saturated as he was with the iron of his early days of
struggle to loot the earth, a surge of delighted interest
thrilled him to the depths of his rough soul. No mother listening
to the first love-story of an only daughter could have been moved
more deeply. His years were nearly twice those of the other, but
it made no difference, unless it were to add to the feeling of
the moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Does she know about it?” he demanded. “Does— Say, her
name’s—she’s daughter to Marty Le Gros? She’s the ‘gal-child,
white,’ Raymes told us of? Say, Bill, I’m crazy for the rest.
Best get right in. I just don’t know a thing. An’ I seem to know
less than ever I did before you began. But you’ve found a gal to
share life with you. And I’m just so glad I can’t rightly say.
Get right on with the yarn an’ I won’t butt in. I’m all out to
pass you any old hand you’re needing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s how I figgered, Chilcoot, knowing you,” Wilder said in
his earnest fashion. “That’s why I told you this thing first. Now
just sit around and I’ll tell you the stuff that looked like a
fairy tale and kept my mouth shut.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder began his story at once and talked on without any sort
of interruption from his companion. Lost in the dark heart of the
ravine, overshadowed by a wintry sky and the rugged, barren,
encompassing walls that rose up and shut out so much of the grey
northern daylight, he told the story as he had learned it, and
pieced together, of the tragedy of the apparently deserted
habitation which he knew to be the home and secret hiding-place
of the one-time leader of the fierce Euralian horde. He told of
the events of his search and vigil in the house from the time of
his discovery of the blinded Japanese, Count Hela, and his
panic-stricken wife, to the final moment when the woman had
pursued him with her story, and sought to bribe him with the
precious map stolen from the murdered missionary. He told it all
in close detail, dwelling upon the mention of the dreaded Usak’s
name by the terror-stricken woman, that the other might follow
out all his subsequent reasoning and re-construction of the story
of Le Gros and his orphaned daughter. He told it right down to
the story of his visit to the Reindeer Farm, on their arrival on
the Caribou, which furnished him with the final
corroboration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There it is, old friend,” he said in conclusion. “Usak, the
husband of the murdered Pri-loo, never gave those folk the chance
to use that map. He deliberately blinded the man and killed his
son. And when I got wise from the map that this precious strike
was on Caribou I got my big notion. I jumped for it right away
and jumped right. This wonderful—Kid—with a face like— Say, I
guessed right away at the start she was the ‘girl-child, white’ I
was chasing up, and the rightful heir to her murdered father’s
‘strike.’ It was that closed up my mouth. I just couldn’t say a
word. We—you boys—the whole outfit were on a gold trail looking
to share in the stuff. And I knew that when it was located, by
every sort of moral right an’ justice, it would belong to the
Kid. And anyway she’d be entitled, an’ all her folks, to the
first rake over of the claims. Ther’ could be nothing for you
boys till her interest was safeguarded. See? She’s the daughter
of Marty Le Gros, and was raised by that murdering Indian, Usak,
who came right along the other night and threatened to clear us
out of Caribou at the muzzle of a rifle that looked to have
served an interior decoration for old Noah’s Ark. Can you beat
it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot shook his head helplessly. The story had lost nothing
from his companion’s telling. He was well-nigh staggered at the
hideous completeness of it all, and certainly amazed. His pipe
had been forgotten until that moment, and he knocked the charred
remains of tobacco out of it on a large flint lying nearby.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder re-lit his pipe and smiled contentedly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do you get what I reckon to do, Chilcoot?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the older man made no effort. He shrugged his broad
shoulders.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d say it ’ud be the sort of crazy stunt most folks wouldn’t
reckon to find come out of the mighty clear head they guess
stands on the shoulders of Bill Wilder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His words were accompanied by a deep-throated chuckle.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe that’s so, boy,” Wilder retorted without umbrage. “But
anyway, it’s a stunt to suit my notion of honesty, and—yours.
See? I sent Mike an’ the bunch off to get ’em right out of the
way while we came along here. That’s all right. Our work’s just
beginning. You an’ me we’re going to get right to it and test out
this queer old canyon. We got the time before winter, if the
thing’s what I guess it is. When we’ve located the stuff ther’s
got to be the pick of the claims for that gal. An’ one each for
Mrs. McLeod, at the farm, and her kids. Then we’ll pass right
down to Placer and make the titles good with the Commissioner.
After that— next Spring—we’ll turn the bunch loose on the ground,
and they can grab how they please. How’s that? Does it go? Yes,
sure it does. I know you. You and me, we can afford to cut right
out and play the game to help these others along. That’s my crazy
notion. Well?” Chilcoot rose to his feet. There was no doubt of
his agreement. An almost child-like delight was stirring his
rugged heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Surely, Bill,” he said simply. “It’s good for me. But that
murdering Indian. Does he come in?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s eyes suddenly sobered. He, too, scrambled to his
feet. And for a moment he stood gazing thoughtfully down the
shadowed ravine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He worries me some,” he admitted at last. “Ther’s things
mighty good in him, I guess. Ther’ must be. He raised the Kid.
But ther’s things mighty bad I haven’t told you about.” Then he
shrugged. “It don’t matter anyway. No, he don’t stand in. Maybe
things’ll happen. We’ll just have to wait. You never can tell
with a darn neche.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A vision of the terrified Japanese woman had risen up before
his mind’s eye. He remembered the nightmare she was enduring at
the thought of Usak’s promised return. Suddenly he flung out his
hands dismissing the vision.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s all queer, Chilcoot,” he cried. “But we must see it
through. It’s strange. To think I’ve had to beat about this darn
old North to find the thing—the only thing to make life worth
while. I could laff, only I don’t feel like laffing. Say, boy,
you just don’t know how I want that—that Kid.”</p>

    <div>CHILDREN OF THE NORTH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Each day the sun’s brief reign was growing less.
There was perhaps six hours of daylight, fiercely bright when the
snow clouds permitted, but otherwise grey and cold, and without
beneficence. To the human mind day was no longer a thing of joy,
but only a respite in which to complete those labours essential
to existence in the northern wilderness before the long twilight
of night finally closed down upon the world.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the farm on the Caribou preparations for the winter were
already in full swing. Already the reindeer herd had been passed
up to the shelter of the hills to roam well-nigh free through the
dark aisles of the woodland bluffs which lined the deeper valleys
of the great divide, out of the heart of which the waters of the
Caribou sprang. The labour of banking the outer walls of the
homestead with soil for greater security against the cold had
been completed. For the ground was already hardening under the
sharp night frosts, and almost any day now might see the first
flurry of snow. Daily the hauling of fuel went on from the
distant forest bluff which sheltered the ruins of the
missionary’s home where the Kid had first seen the light of the
northern day. And this work was undertaken by the boys, and the
half-breed Eskimos, whose work amongst the deer herd had ceased
with its departure to the hills in search of winter keep.</p>

<p class='c010'>Life just now was a sheer routine. A routine which demanded
faithful observance. The least neglect might well spell disaster
for those who knew the narrowness of the margin in human victory
over the merciless winter season. But these northern people knew
the routine of it by heart, and nothing would be neglected,
nothing forgotten. The haulage of fuel would go on far into the
winter, and when the world froze up and the white pall was spread
over its dead body only the method of its transport would be
changed.</p>

<p class='c010'>But for all the drear of outlook in the coming season life was
apparently no less the care-free thing which the youth of the
farm so surely made it appear. Childish laughter was proof
against a falling sun. It was proof against the anxious labour of
it all, just as it was proof against the contemplation of
unending darkness. It was almost as though the change had its
appeal. Was not the twilight of winter something to inspire
imagination? Was not the fierce blizzard, when the world was
completely blinded for days on end, something to confront and
defy with all the hardy spirit of youth? Was not the brilliant
aurora something about which to weave romantic dreams as
fantastic as was the great crescent of dancing light itself? And
the ghostly northern lights, and the brilliant night-lit heavens,
with their moon, and reflected moons, were not these matters in
which the budding human mind could find a wealth of inspiration
for the riot of imagination?</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, the long night of winter was not without its appeal to
the young life on the Caribou River. Only was it for those
elders, who knew its desperateness, who had long since learned
the littleness of human life in the monstrous battle of the
elements, a season of grave anxiety that left them indifferent to
the irresponsible imaginings and dreamings of those at the
threshold of life.</p>

<p class='c010'>For Mary Justicia down to the youthful Jane Constance, with
her curling brown hair and her velvet dark eyes, the coming of
winter was a season of exciting interest. And this year even more
so than usual. This year there was a curious hopeful change in
their lives. The measure of it, perhaps, they failed to fully
understand. But the effect was there, and they felt its
influence. They one and all knew that Usak had returned with a
really good trade. Usak was the genius of their lives, and this
year he had waved his magic wand to some purpose. They had heard
whispers amongst their elders of a good time coming. They had
heard the Kid and their mother discussing colours and materials
for suitings. They had heard talks of dollars in thousands. And
visions of canned delicacies, of nice, fat, sticky syrup, and
succulent preserves, had crept into their yearning minds.</p>

<p class='c010'>But that was not all. There was a wondrous change in the hero
of their youthful worship. The Kid’s smile was rarely shadowed as
she ordered their lives. A soft delight looked out of her pretty
eyes which shone with happy contentment whatever their childish
aggravations. Then the mother of them all. Infrequent and gentle
as were her scoldings generally, just now she seemed to have
utterly forgotten her dispensing of them. The wash tub claimed
her, her needle claimed her, her cooking claimed her, leaving her
happily oblivious to their many and frequent shortcomings.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then there were the gold seekers on the river. The laughing,
red-headed Irishman, who had vanished up the river with the
rivermen and those poorer whites in whom they were less
interested. But the two others visited the homestead pretty
regularly, and laughed, and talked, and did their best to make
life one long joy for them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Especially was this the case with the man Bill Wilder. Bill
Wilder had caught the fancy of all, from their mother down to the
merry Janey, whose table manners were a source of never-ending
anxiety to Hesther. The children loved him as children will so
often love a big man who is never reluctant to encourage their
games. Perse clung to him at every opportunity. Was he not a gold
man, and was not his coming to Caribou a justification of his own
boyish dreams of gold? Clarence found in him a kindred spirit of
the trail. And Alg sought his advice on his domestic labours on
any and every excuse. But Gladys Anne and Janey were his
favourites—next to the smiling Kid.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the mother looked on, watchful and wisely alert. Her busy
mind was full of speculation and contentment. She was thinking
how she and her brood would fare should these men ultimately find
the gold they sought. She refused to build on the notion. It was
not her way. And just now, as a result of Usak’s return, she felt
that ways and means were less pressing, and so, in her easy
philosophy, that aspect of the position was permitted to drift
into the background.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid was her main thought just now. Her woman’s wisdom was
sufficient for her to grasp the real meaning of Wilder’s frequent
attendance at the farm. It was plainly written in his manner. It
was still more plainly written in the manner of the girl in his
absence. She had long since dragged the full story of their
original meeting at the Hekor rapids from the diffident and
almost reluctant girl. She had laughingly chidden her for her
long reticence. She had even admonished her for the invitation
she had flung at him, a gold man stranger.</p>

<p class='c010'>But under it all, away back in her simple woman’s mind she
nursed the romance of it all, and hoped and hoped, while yet she
gravely feared for the orphan she had mothered.</p>

<p class='c010'>The brief days flew rapidly by. Almost every night the tall
figure of Wilder came up from the river bearing something for
their supper, which he was scrupulously determined to share. The
meal was partaken of by the yellow light of an oil lamp. Big
Bill, as the children loved to call him, was for a brief while a
part of the family, and sat around in the warm kitchen, smoking
and laughing, and submitting to the ready banter which his search
for gold on the Caribou inspired. Then later he strode off to his
canoe lying drawn up on the river bank, and, not infrequently, he
was accompanied by some of the elder children, and on occasions
by the Kid, herself, alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>Of all the folk at the homestead Usak took no delight in these
visits. He definitely resented them. But he said no word, and
simply refrained from taking any part in the welcome extended to
the intruding whiteman. There was never a protest forthcoming.
His protest had been made on the occasion he had stirred the Kid
to wrath, and he had no desire to experience another such
encounter. So he remained at his labours in his own quarters,
watchful, alert, determined. And he made his preparations for the
winter trail which was to yield something approaching affluence
for those he served.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was at the end of his first week on the river that Bill’s
voice hailed the homestead as he came up from the landing,
bearing a string of a dozen or more speckled mountain trout. The
night was dark with heavy cloud, but the younger children raced
out of the house to meet him at his summons.</p>

<p class='c010'>A few moments later Perse dashed into his mother’s presence
flourishing the shining fish at her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s a dandy bunch, Mum,” he cried, sprawling them on the
table. “They’re for supper. Big Bill’s comin’ right along up with
Janey an’ Gladys Anne.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned to the Kid who was gazing down at the fish without
any display of interest. The boy’s grinning eyes were full of
mischief. He came round to her side and looked into her unsmiling
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess you didn’t get it, Kid,” he said. “Big Bill’s comin’
right along up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he jumped and ran for the door under a swift cuff that
came from his mother’s work-worn hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Be right off you imp o’ perdition,” she cried. “The Kid ain’t
worried whose comin’ to this house. Ef I get that talk agin
ther’s a rawhide waitin’ on you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she moved to the girl’s side. She reached up and laid a
sympathetic hand on her slim shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, Kid,” she said, with a gentle smile. “Ther’s scarce a
night he don’t come along.” She glanced hastily round the room to
be sure they were alone. “Are you kind o’ glad?” she ventured
anxiously. “Does it make you feel sort o’—glad?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl smiled down into the soft brown eyes. She nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Mum, I’m just glad all through.” She paused. “But I was
kind of thinking. It was fixed Clarence was to make the trail to
Placer with Usak. Well, Usak don’t reckon it’s safe to trust to
him—a boy. He figgers I best go.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mother nodded. Then she drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s queer,” she said. “I reckon he hates Big Bill
Wilder.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid laughed, but it was without mirth.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He surely does, Mum,” she said with bitter emphasis.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The man was standing just inside the doorway. The pleasant
warmth was welcome enough in contrast to the sharp night air
outside. But he made no attempt to remove the seal parka which
had replaced the thick pea-jacket he usually wore.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said with a laugh, in response to the mother’s urging
to “sit around” while she prepared the supper. “Guess I’m not
eating with you dear folk to-night.” His gaze sought the shyly
smiling eyes of the Kid. “There aren’t enough of those trout to
make a right feed for the bunch. And, anyway, Chilcoot and I are
making a party to ourselves.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned to the mother who was at the stove, about to shake
down the ashes and fire-up for the preparation of the evening
meal.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’d have fancied askin’ you all, the whole bunch, to come
right along up and eat with us. But I guess the kiddies need to
make their blankets early, and anyway our camp fixings aren’t
unlimited. So we reckoned to ask you, mam, and the Kid, here, and
say one of the boys. That ’ud leave Mary and the other standing
guard over the bunch of mischief you leave behind to see they
don’t choke themselves. And there’s always the great Usak to see
no harm comes to them. Do you feel like making the trip?
Chilcoot’s waiting around at the landing, and ther’s two canoes
to take us up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, if that ain’t real mean.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Perse, who had flung himself into the chair usually at
the disposal of Big Bill on his evening visits. His small body
was lost in the ample rawhide seat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I call that dirt mean,” he went on, in an aggrieved treble.
“What you makin’ the party for, Bill? Ha’ you made the big
‘strike’?” Then his intelligent grey eyes turned shrewdly on the
Kid. “Guess I know though. I’ll—”</p>

<p class='c010'>For a second time he hastily vacated the room. The ready hand
of the mother, quick as it was, had no time to descend before he
had jumped clear.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” she cried after him, “you beat it, and send Clarence
along right at once. He’s working around with Usak an’ Alg in the
fur store. You ken send Mary Justicia right along, too.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she turned to the smiling man who found keen amusement in
the outrageous Perse.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s an imp, that’s what he is,” she declared, while the Kid
moved quickly to the stove and shook it down. “But that’s real
kind of you, Bill. I’d like fine to come along and eat with you,
but I guess these ‘God’s Blessings’ o’ mine ’ud run wild without
me. Would you fancy takin’ Mary Justicia along, and that bright
little feller, Perse, an’ Clarence, an’ the Kid? I’ll pass Perse
a word and set him behavin’ right. He’ll make one more bit for
you to feed than you reckon, but I don’t guess that’ll worry your
outfit. He can take his own platter an’ pannikin. He’d be mighty
grieved not to go. You see, he thinks Big Bill the greatest
proposition north o’ ‘sixty’—seeing he guesses ther’s gold on
Caribou.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman’s eyes twinkled with humour as she concluded with
the now time-honoured jest at her visitor’s expense.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded good-humouredly, and his eyes sought the face of
the girl standing in the background beside the stove.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure,” he said. “I’ll be real glad for the boy to come
along.” He laughed. “Ther’ won’t be anything fancy for him t’
eat. It’s just duck, an’ some trout, an’ some canned truck. But
I’d sure be glad. Wot you say, Kid?” he asked, his tone not
without a shade of concern. “Will you come along up with us? I’d
been mighty thankful for your Mum to share in, but I sort of knew
beforehand the social whirl on Caribou hadn’t a claim on her to
compare with her ‘God’s Blessings.’ Will you come? Chilcoot
reckons he’s all sorts of a feller at entertaining women folk to
supper. An’ maybe he’ll start in to yarn of the gold trail, an’
we’ll be hard set to stop him. Ther’s an elegant moon for the
trip. And you’ll all be right back before she sets.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His manner was light but behind it was real earnestness, and a
shade of anxiety. Hesther, all the mother in her alert, was swift
to detect it. She smiled encouragingly round on the girl.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid nodded. Her gaze was averted with just a shadow of
shyness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d just love the trip,” she declared quickly. Then her
shyness passed and her sweet blue eyes laughed happily into the
man’s face. “What is it? Have you found Perse’s color? Ther’s
sure something back of this,” she went on in delighted enjoyment,
as she watched the man’s expressive face as he strove for
unconcern. She shook her head. “No,” she declared. “Guess it’s
not Perse’s gold. I guess you reckon Mum’s cooking isn’t the
thing she believes, and you’re goin’ to show us the sort of swell
thing Chilcoot and you make of it. My! I’m dying to see how two
great men live on the trail. Sure I’ll come, an’ so will Mary,
an’ Clarence, an’ Perse. Do we need to fix ourselves for the
party? Perse most always needs fixing, anyway.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a laugh in every word the girl spoke, and to the man
it was a delight to listen to her, and to watch the play of her
expressive face.</p>

<p class='c010'>To the mother eyes there was that in the girl’s manner which
wholly escaped the man. She knew the Kid was striving with
everything in her power to conceal the feelings Wilder had so
deeply stirred in her. She sighed quietly, and hoped and prayed
that all might be for the best happiness of the girl she had come
to lean on so surely in the battle they fought together for
existence. She only had her instinct to guide her. She had no
real worldly wisdom. She liked the steady, honest gaze of Bill’s
eyes. So she yielded to that best philosophy in the world, which,
in sober moments, she was wont to hurl at her inquiring
offspring: “Act right, an’ eat good, an’ don’t worry to get after
Fate with a club.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill laughed. He was in the mood to laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said. “Come right along, just as you’re fixed.
Chilcoot don’t reckon to receive you in swallowtails. Maybe he’s
greased his roof with seal oil to make it shine some. I can’t
say. Ah, here’s Clarence, an’ Mary, and Master Perse. Now beat it
all of you and get right into parkas. Your Mum figgers to be rid
of you awhile so you’re coming right along to eat with me. Guess
Chilcoot’ll be nigh frozen to death waiting down at the
river.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The leanto was shadowed. The single oil lamp cast its feeble
rays on the general litter. And the scene was characteristic of
the Indian whose methods obtained so largely in the running of
the farm.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak laboured silently, grimly amongst the shadows. His
movements were in that quiet fashion which the padding of
moccasined feet on an earthen floor never fails to intensify. He
was quite alone now, for the last of his helpers had departed at
the urgent summons of the boy, Perse, who had bidden them to the
presence of their visitor.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s dusky face was hard-set as he moved about amongst
his chattels. His black eyes were narrowed and pre-occupied.
There were moments when he paused from his labours and stood
listening. It was as though he expected some jarring sound which
he was ready to resent and hate with all the strength of his
heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was at such moments that his gaze seemed inevitably to be
drawn to the long, old rifle leaning against the wall just within
the wide doorway. It was his life-long friend. It was his oldest
associate in his lighter as well as his darker moods. And just
now his mood left him yearning for the feel of its ancient
trigger under a mercilessly compressing forefinger.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was sorting and classifying his summer trade, and
preparing it for transport. Pelts lay scattered about, and the
smell of pepper, and other preservatives, was in the air. The
long sled was set on its runners, repaired, and ready to face the
coming winter trail to Placer. And about it, littered in almost
hopeless confusion, was an ill assortment of camp outfit which
needed cleansing and repair. The whole scene was of the tentative
preparations of the trail man. There might be many weeks before
the snow and freeze-up would make the journey possible. But Usak
was possessed of that restless spirit which refuses to submit to
idleness, and whose sense of responsibility drove him at all
times.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the moments passed his pauses from the work of sorting and
bestowing became prolonged. Once he passed to the doorway and
stood out in the chill night air, and his sense of hearing was
clearly directed to windward where the night breeze came directly
across the white-folk’s portion of the rambling habitation. And
on its breath sounds of laughter and happy voices came to him.
And amongst them he was clearly able to distinguish the strong,
deep tones of the big man whose presence he so deeply resented on
the river.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood thus for some moments. Then a sharp sound escaped his
set lips and he passed again within, as though in self-defence
against the passions which the sound of that hated voice had
stirred.</p>

<p class='c010'>His examination of the skins had lost its deliberateness. He
picked them up and flung them aside only half scrutinized. And,
at last, he abandoned his task altogether. He deliberately
squatted on the blackened, up-turned bottom of an iron camp
kettle, and sat staring out into the dark night in the direction
in which he knew lay the landing at the river bank.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no longer any attempt to hide the desperateness of
his mood. It was in every line of his dusky features; it was in
the coming and going of his turbulent breathing; it was in the
smouldering fire that shone in his black eyes. The native savage
was definitely uppermost. And insane passion was driving.</p>

<p class='c010'>He remained, statue-like, on his improvised seat, and every
sound that reached him from the house was noted and interpreted.
Sometimes the sounds were so low as to be almost inaudible.
Sometimes they were the sounds of laughter. Sometimes they smote
his ears with clear definite words, for the night was very still,
and the darkness rendered his animal-like hearing profoundly
acute.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly there came the opening and shutting of a door, and
with it a sound of voices and laughter. He started. He rose from
his seat and moved almost furtively to the doorway, and his hand
instinctively fell upon the muzzle of his leaning rifle.</p>

<p class='c010'>He listened intently. The voices were still plain, but
becoming rapidly fainter. Yes. He could clearly distinguish the
individual tones he knew so well. He heard the voice of the Kid.
And replies came in the voice of the man. There were other
voices, but somehow, they seemed quite apart from these two.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could stand it no longer. He turned about and extinguished
the lamp. Then he moved over to his leaning rifle and possessed
himself of his old friend. Just for one moment he remained
listening. Then, with a curious movement suggesting a shrugging
of his great shoulders, he passed out into the night.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

    <div>YOUTH SUPREME</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The silence of the night was broken by the sounds
of youthful voices, and the gentle splash of the driving paddles.
There was laughter, and the passing backwards and forwards of
care-free, light-hearted banter. Now and again came the deeper
note of strong men’s voices, but for the most part it was the
shriller treble of early youth that invaded the serene hush of
the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>The two small canoes glided rapidly up the winding ribbon of
moon-lit waters. They were driven by eager, skilful hands, hands
with a life-training for the work. And so they sped on in that
smooth fashion which the rhythmic dip of the paddle never fails
to yield.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid was at the foremost strut of the leading canoe with
Big Bill Wilder at the stern. Their passenger was the
irrepressible Perse, who lounged amidships on a folded blanket.
Behind them came the sturdy form of Chilcoot Massy guiding the
destiny of the second vessel which carried the youth, Clarence,
and the sedate form of Mary Justicia lifted, for the moment, out
of the sense of her responsibility, which years of deputising for
her mother in the care of her brothers and sisters had impressed
upon her young mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hearts were light enough as they glided through the chill
night air. Even Chilcoot Massy, so perilously near to middle
life—and perhaps because of it—found the youthful gaiety of his
guests irresistible. It was a journey of delighted, frothing
spirits rising triumphant over the dour brooding of the cold
heart of the desolate territory which had given them birth.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cold moon had driven forth the earlier bankings of
snow-clouds. It lit the low-spread earth from end to end, a
precious beacon, which, in the months to come, would be the
reigning heavenly light. The velvet heavens, studded with myriads
of sparkling jewels, and slashed again and again from end to end
with the lightning streak of shooting stars, were filled with a
superlative vision of dancing northern light. The ghostliness of
it all was teeming with a sense of romance, the romance which
fills the dreams of later life when the softening of recollection
has rubbed down the harshnesses of the living reality.</p>

<p class='c010'>The delight of this sudden break in the crudeness of life
waxed in the hearts of these children of the North. There were
moments when silence fell, and the hush of the world crowded full
of the ominous threat which lies at the back of everything as the
winter season approaches. But all such moments were swiftly
dismissed, as though, subconsciously, its dampening influence
were felt, and the moment was ripe for sheer rebellion. It was an
expression of the sturdy spirit which the Northland breeds.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no thought of lurking danger other than the dangers
they were bred to. How should there be? Was not this Caribou
River, with its spring floodings, with its summer meanderings,
with its winter casing of ice, right down to the very heart of
its bed, their very own highway and play ground? Did not these
folk know its every vagary from the icy moods of winter, to its
beneficent summer delights? How then could it hold for them the
least shadow of terror on a night to be given up to a gaiety such
as their lives rarely enough knew?</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet the shadow was there, a grim, voiceless shadow, soundless
as death, and as unrelenting in its pursuit. A kyak moved over
the silvery bosom of the water hard behind the rear-most canoe of
the revellers, driven by a brown hand which made no sound as the
paddle it grasped passed to and fro, without lifting, through the
gleaming water.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a light hide kyak, a mere shell that scarce had the
weight of a thing of feathers. And the brown man driving it was
its only burden, unless the long old rifle lying thrusting up
from its prow could be counted. It crept through the shallows
dangerously near to the river bank, and every turn in the
twisting course of the silver highway was utilized as a screen
from any chance glance cast backwards by those whose course it
was dogging.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shadowy pursuit went on. It went on right up to within a
furlong of the final landing. For the mood of the brown man was
relentless with every passion of original man stirring. But he
never shortened by a yard the distance that lay between him and
his quarry. And as the leading boats drew into the side, and the
beacon light of a great camp fire suddenly changed the silvery
tone of the night, the pursuing kyak shot into the bank far
behind, and the brown man leapt ashore.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The feast was over. And what a feast it had been. There had
been mountain trout, caught and prepared by the grizzled camp
cook, whose atmosphere of general uncleanness emphasised his
calling, and who was the only other living creature in this camp
on the gravel flats. There had been baked duck, stuffed with some
conglomeration of chopped “sow-belly,” the mixing of which was
the cook’s most profound secret. There had been syrupy canned
fruit, and canned sweet corn, and canned beans with tomato. There
had been real coffee. Not the everlasting stewed tea of the
trail. And then there had been canned milk full of real
cream.</p>

<p class='c010'>That was the feast. But there had been much more than the
simple joy of feasting. There had been laughter and high spirits,
and a wild delight. How Perse had eaten and talked. How Clarence
had eaten and listened. How the Kid had shyly smiled, while Bill
Wilder played his part as host, and looked to the comfort of
everybody. Then Mary Justicia. There was no cleaning to do after.
There was no Janey to wipe at intervals. So she had given all her
generous attention to the profound yarning of the trail-bounded
Chilcoot Massy.</p>

<p class='c010'>The happy interim was drawing to a close. The camp fire was
blazing mountains high, a prodigal waste of precious fuel at such
a season. And the revellers were squatting around at a respectful
distance, contemplating it, and settling to a calm sobriety in
various conditions of delighted repletion.</p>

<p class='c010'>The cold moonlight was forgotten. The chill of the air could
no longer be felt with the proximity of the fire. The Coming
season gave no pause for a moment’s regret. The only thought to
disturb utter contentment was that soon, all too soon, the
routine of life would close down again, and, one and all, it
would envelop them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill was lounging on a spread of skin rug, and the Kid and
Mary Justicia shared it with him. A yard away Chilcoot, who could
never rise above a seat on an upturned camp pot, was smoking and
addressing Clarence, and the more restless Perse, much in the
fashion of a mentor. Their talk was of the trail, the gold trail,
as it was bound to be with the veteran guiding it. He was
narrating stories of “strikes,” rich “strikes,” and wild rushes.
He was recounting adventures which seemed literally to stream out
of his cells of memory to the huge enjoyment, and wonder, and
excitement of his youthful audience. And it was into the midst of
this calm delight the final uplift of the night’s entertainment
came.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole thing was planned and worked up to. Chilcoot had led
along the road through his wealth of narrative. He was telling
the story of Eighty-Mile Creek. Of the great bonanza that had
fallen into the laps of himself and Bill Wilder. Of the
tremendous rush after he and his partner had secured their
claims.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It was us boys who located the whole darn ‘strike’” he said
appreciatively. “Us two. Bill an’ me. Say, they laffed. How they
laffed when we beat it up Eighty-Mile. Gold? Gee! Ther’ wasn’t
colour other than grey mud anywheres along its crazy course.
That’s how the boys said. They said: ‘Beat it right up it an’
feed the timber wolves.’ They said—But, say, I jest can’t hand
you haf the things them hoodlams chucked at us. But Bill’s got a
nose fer gold that ’ud locate it on a skunk farm. He knew, an’ I
was ready to foiler him if it meant feedin’ any old thing my
carkiss. My, I want to laff. It was the same as your Mum said
when she heard we’d come along here chasin’ gold, only worse. She
couldn’t hand the stuff the boys could. An’ queer enough, now I
think it, Eighty-Mile was as nigh like this dam creek as two
shucks. Ther’s the mud, an’ the queer gravel, an’ the granite.
Guess ther’ ain’t the cabbige around this lay out like ther’ was
to Eighty-Mile. You see, we’re a heap further north, right here.
No. Ther’ was spruce, an’ pine, an’ tamarack to Eighty-Mile.
Ther’s nothing better than dyin’ skitters an’ hies you can smell
a mile to Caribou. But the formation’s like. Sure it is. An’
Bill’s nose—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Cut out the nose, Chilcoot, old friend,” Wilder broke in with
a laugh. “Ther’s a deal too much of my nose to this precious
yarn. What you coming to?”</p>

<p class='c010'>A merry laugh from the Kid found an echo in Perse’s noisy
grin.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s good listenin’ to a yarn of gold,” he said. “It don’t
hurt hanging it up so we get the gold plenty at the end.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so boy,” Chilcoot nodded approvingly. “That’s the gold
man talkin’. That’s how it was on Eighty-Mile. Ther’ was just
tons of gold, an’ we netted the stuff till we was plumb sick to
death countin’ it. Gold? Gee! Bill’s bank roll is that stuffed
with it he could buy a—territory. Yes, that was Eighty-Mile, the
same as it is on—Caribou!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Caribou?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Perse had leapt to his feet staring wide-eyed in his
amazement. The Kid had faced round gazing incredulously into
Wilder’s smiling face. Even Mary Justicia was drawing deep
breaths under her habitual restraint. The one apparently unmoved
member of the happy party was Clarence. But even his attitude was
feigned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Same as it is on—Caribou?” he said, in a voice whose tone
hovered between youth and manhood. “Have you struck it
on—Caribou?”</p>

<p class='c010'>His final question was tense with suppressed excitement.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot nodded in Bill’s direction.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ask him,” he said, with a smile twinkling in his eyes. “It’s
that he got you kids for right here this night. Jest to ask him
that question. Have you made the ‘strike,’ Bill? Did your darn
old nose smell out right? You best tell these folks, or you’ll
hand ’em a nightmare they won’t get over in a week. You best tell
’em. Or maybe you ken show ’em. Ther’s folk in the world like to
see, when gold’s bein’ talked, an’ I guess Perse here’s one of
’em. Will you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>All eyes were on Big Bill. The girls sat voicelessly waiting,
and the smiles on their faces were fixed with the intensity of
the feeling behind them. Clarence, like Perse, had stood up in
his agitation, and both boys gazed wide-eyed as the tall figure
leapt to its feet and passed back to the low “A” tent, which was
his quarters.</p>

<p class='c010'>While he was gone Chilcoot strove to fill in the interval with
appropriate comment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he said, “Caribou’s chock full of the dust, an’—”</p>

<p class='c010'>But no one was listening. Four pair of eyes were gazing after
Big Bill, four hearts were hammering in four youthful bosoms
under stress of feelings which in all human life the magic of
gold never fails to arouse. It was the same with these simple
creatures, who had never known a sight of gold, as it was with
the most hardened labourer of the gold trail. Everything but the
prize these men had won was forgotten in that thrilling
moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder came back almost at once. He was bearing a riffled pan,
one of those primitive manufactures which is so great a thing in
the life of the man who worships at the golden shrine. He was
bearing it in both hands as though its contents were weighty. And
as he came, the Kid, no less eagerly than the others, hurriedly
dashed to his side to peer at the thing he was carrying.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the pan was covered with bagging. And the man smilingly
denied them all.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Get right along back,” he laughed. “Sit around and I’ll show
you.” Then his eyes gazed down into the Kid’s upturned face, and
he realised her moment of sheer excitement had passed and
something else was stirring behind the pretty eyes that had come
to mean so much to him. He nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t be worried, Kid,” he said quietly. “Maybe I guess the
thing that’s troubling. I’m going to fix that, the same as I
reckon to fix anything else that’s going to make you feel
bad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl made no reply. In her mind the shadow of Usak had
arisen. And even to her, in the circumstances, it was a
threatening shadow. She remembered the thing the savage had said
to her in his violent protest. “Him mans your enemy. Him come
steal all thing what are yours. Him river. Him land. Him—gold.”
There was nothing in her thought that this man was stealing from
her. Such a thing could never have entered her mind. It was the
culminating threat of the savage that had robbed her of her
delight, and made the thing in the pan almost hateful to her.
Usak had deliberately threatened the life of this man, and the
full force of that threat, hitherto almost disregarded, now
overwhelmed her with a terror such as she had never known
before.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was the last to take her place on the spread of skins
before the fire. The others were crowding round the man with the
pan. But he kept them waiting till the girl had taken her place
beside him. Then, and not till then, without a word he squatted
on the rugs and slowly withdrew the bagging.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a breathless moment. Everything was forgotten but the
amazing revelation. Even the Kid, in that supreme moment, found
the shadow of Usak less haunting. The bagging was drawn
clear.</p>

<p class='c010'>There it lay in the bottom of the pan. A number of dull,
yellow, jagged nuggets lying on a bed of yellow dust nearly half
an inch thick.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Perse who found the first words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Phew!” he cried with something resembling a whistle. “Dollars
an’ dollars! How many? Did you get it on— Caribou?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. Right on Caribou.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded, his eyes contemplating his treasure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Where?”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was Clarence who asked the vital question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You can’t get that—yet.” Wilder shook his head without
looking up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mum would be crazy to see this,” ventured the thoughtful Mary
Justicia.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid looked up. She had been dazzled by the splendid
vision. Now again terror was gripping her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’ll not say a word of this. None of you,” she said
sharply. “Mum shall know. Oh, yes. But not a word to—Usak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder raised his eyes to the girl’s troubled face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t worry a thing,” he said gravely. “Usak’s going to know.
I’m going to hand him the talk myself.” Then he laughed. And the
tone of his laugh added further to the girl’s unease. It was so
care-free and delighted. “Sit around, kids,” he cried. “All of
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He was promptly obeyed by the two boys who had remained
standing. They seated themselves opposite him. Then he dipped
into the pan and picked out the largest of the nuggets of pure
gold and offered it to the Kid.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s for your Mum,” he said quietly. “It’s pure gold, same
as the woman she is. Here,” he went on, quickly selecting the
next biggest. “That’s yours Kid— by right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he passed one each to the two boys and Mary Justicia, and
finally shot the remainder of the precious wash-up into the bag
that had covered the pan and held it out to the Kid.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There it is,” he cried. “Take it. It’s for you, an’ all those
folk belonging to you. It’s just a kind of sample of the thing
that’s yours, an’ is going to be yours. Guess old Perse, here,
was right. It’s the gold from Caribou, an’ right out of your dead
father’s ‘strike’— which is for you, Kid. Say, you’re a rich
woman, for the best claim on it is yours, an’ it’s the richest
‘strike’ I’ve ever nosed out. Richer even than Chilcoot’s
Eighty-Mile.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The party was over. The journey back to the homestead was
completed. The full moon had smiled frigidly down upon a scene of
such excitement as was rare enough in her northern domain. Maybe
the sight of the thing she had witnessed had offended her.
Perhaps, with her wealth of cold experience, she condemned the
humanness of the thing she had gazed upon. For on the journey
home she had refused the beneficence of her pale smile, and had
hidden her face amidst those night shadows which she had
forthwith summoned to her domain.</p>

<p class='c010'>But her displeasure had in nowise concerned. A landmark in
life had been set up, a radiant beacon which would shine in the
minds of each and every one of these children of the North so
long as memory remained to them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somehow the order of return home to the homestead had become
changed. Neither Wilder nor the Kid realised the thing that had
taken place until it had been accomplished. It seemed likely that
it was the deliberate work of Chilcoot, who, for all his
roughness, was not without a world of kindly sentiment somewhere
stowed away deep down in his heart. Perhaps it had been the
arrangement of the less demonstrative Mary Justicia, who was so
nearly approaching her own years of womanhood. However it had
come to pass Chilcoot had carried off the bulk of the visitors,
with Mary and Perse and Clarence for his freight, leaving Bill
and the Kid to their own company in following his lead.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the ultimate crowning of the night’s episodes for the
Kid. Bill had demanded that she become his passenger; that the
sole work of paddling should be his. And he had had his way. The
Kid was in the mood for yielding to his lightest wish. If he had
desired to walk to the homestead she would not have demurred. So
she lounged on skin rugs amidships in the little canoe, with her
shoulders propped against the forward strut, and yielded herself
to the delight with which the talk and presence of this great,
strong, youthful man filled her. The shadow of Usak still haunted
her silent moments, but even that, in this wonderful presence,
had less power to disturb.</p>

<p class='c010'>The impulse of the man had been to abandon all caution, and
bask in the delight and happiness with which this child of nature
filled him. Her beauty and sweet womanhood compelled him utterly,
while her innocence was beyond words in the sense of tender
responsibility it inspired in him. He loved her with all the
strength of his own simple being. And the sordid world in which
he dwelt so long only the more surely left him headlong in his
great desire.</p>

<p class='c010'>But out of his wisdom he restrained the impulse. Time was with
him and he feared to frighten her. He realised that for all her
courage, for all her wonderful spirit in the fierce northern
battle, the woman’s crown of life must be as yet something little
more than a hazy vision, a nebulous thing whose reality would
only come to her, stealing softly upon her as the budding soul
expanded. Yes, he could afford to wait. And so he held guard over
himself, and the journey was made while he told her all those
details of the thing that had brought him to Caribou.</p>

<p class='c010'>His mind was very clear on the things he desired to tell, and
the things he did not. And he confined himself to a sufficient
outline of the reasons of the thing he was doing with his
discovery on Caribou, and the things he contemplated before the
opening after the coming winter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The journey down the river sufficed for this outline of his
purpose, and the distance was covered almost before they were
aware of it. At the landing they looked for the others. But they
only discovered Chilcoot’s empty boat, which left them no
alternative but to walk up to the homestead.</p>

<p class='c010'>As they approached the clearing the girl held out a hand.
“Will I take that—bag?” she asked. “I—I’d like to show it to Mum
with my own hands. You know, Bill, I can’t get it all yet. All it
means. It’s a sort of dream yet, an’ all the time I sort of feel
I’ll wake right up an’ set out for Placer to make our winter
trade.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She laughed. But her laugh was cut short. And as the man
passed her the bag of dust he had been carrying a spasm of
renewed fear gripped her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. I’d forgotten,” she went on. “I’d forgotten Usak. This
thing’s kind of beaten everything out of my fool head. You’re
going to tell him, Bill? When?” They had reached the clearing and
halted a few yards from the home the Kid had always known. The
sound of voices came to them from within. There was laughter and
excitement reigning, when, usually, the whole household should
have been wrapped in slumber.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right away. Maybe to-morrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill stood before her silhouetted against the lamplight
shining through the cotton-covered window of the kitchen-place.
There was something comforting in the man’s bulk, and in the
strong tones of his voice. The Kid’s fears relaxed, but anxiety
was still hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Say, little gal,” he went on at once, in that tender fashion
he had come to use in his talk with her. “That feller’s got you
scared.” He laughed. “I guess he’s the only thing to scare you in
this queer territory. But he doesn’t scare me a thing. I’ve got
him beat all the while—when it comes to a show-down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe you have in a—show-down.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I get your meaning,” he said. “But don’t worry.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I do. I can’t help it.” The Kid’s tone was a little
desperate. “You see, I know Usak. I’ve known him all my life. He
threatened your life to me the night he found you on the river. I
jumped in on him and beat that talk out of him. But—you see, he
reckons you’re out to steal our land, our river, our—gold. It’s
the last that scares me. If he knows the stuff’s found, and
unless he knows right away the big things you’re doing—Don’t you
see? Oh, I’m scared for you, Bill. Usak’s crazy mad if he thinks
folk are going to hurt me. You’ll tell him quick, won’t you? I
won’t sleep till I’m—sure. You see, if a thing happened to
you—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing’s goin’ to happen, little Kid. I sure promise
you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s words came deep, and low, and thrilling with
something he could not keep out of them. It was the girl’s
unfeigned solicitude that stirred him. And again the old headlong
impulse was striving to gain the upper hand. He resisted it, as
he had resisted it before.</p>

<p class='c010'>But this time he sought the coward’s refuge. He reached out a
hand and laid it gently on the girl’s soft shoulder.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come right in, an’—show your Mum,” he said. “Hark at ’em.
That’s Perse. I’d know his laugh in a thousand. Say, we’re
missing all sorts of a time.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The two men were back at their camp. They were seated over the
remains of their generous camp fire. It had sadly fallen from its
great estate. It was no longer a prodigal expression of their
hospitality, but a mere, ruddy heap of hot cinders with a wisp of
smoke rising out of its glowing heart. Still, however, it yielded
a welcome temperature to the bitter chill of the now frowning
night.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot remained faithful to his up-turned camp kettle, but
Bill concerned himself with no such luxury. He was squatting
Indian-fashion on his haunches, with his hands clasped about his
knees. It was a moment of deep contemplation before seeking their
blankets, and both were smoking.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the older man who broke the long silence. He was in a
mood to talk, for the events of the night had stirred him even
more deeply than he knew.</p>

<p class='c010'>“They felt mighty good,” he observed contentedly. “Them queer
bits o’ life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His gaze remained on the heart of the fire for his words were
in the manner of a thought spoken aloud.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pore kids,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a moment the older man’s eyes were turned upon him, and
their smiling depths were full of amiable derision.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Pore?” he exclaimed. Then his hands were outspread in an
expressive gesture. “Say, you’ve handed ’em a prize-packet that
needs to cut that darn word right out of your talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked for reply to his challenge, but none was
forthcoming. And he returned again to his happy contemplation of
the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill smoked on. But somehow there was none of the other’s easy
contentment in his enjoyment. He was smoking rapidly, in the
manner of a mind that was restless, of a thought unpleasantly
pre-occupied. The expression of his eyes, too, was entirely
different. They were plainly alert, and a light pucker of
concentration had drawn his even brows together. He seemed to be
listening. Nor was his listening for the sound of his companion’s
voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>At long last Chilcoot bestirred himself and knocked out his
pipe, and his eyes again sought his silent partner.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The blankets fer me,” he said, and rose to his feet. He
laughed quietly. “I’ll sure dream of kids an’ things all mussed
up with fool men who don’t know better.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.” Bill nodded without turning. Then he added: “You best
make ’em. I’ll sit awhile.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot’s gaze sharpened as he contemplated the squatting
figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Kind o’ feel like thinkin’ some?” he observed shrewdly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Maybe.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The older man grinned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“She’d take most boys o’ your years—thinkin’!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ye—es.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill had turned, and was gazing up into the other’s smiling
face. But there was no invitation to continue the talk in his
regard. On the contrary. And Chilcoot’s smile passed
abruptly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess I’ll beat it,” he said a little hurriedly. And the
sitting man made no attempt to detain him.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The man at the fire was no longer gazing into it. He was
peering out into the dark of the night. Furthermore he was no
longer squatting on his haunches. He had shifted his position,
lying on his side so that his range of vision avoided the
fire-light as he searched in the direction of the water’s edge
below him. His heavy pea-jacket had been unfastened, and his
right hand was thrust deep in its pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fire had been replenished and raked together. It was
burning merrily, as though the man before it contemplated a
prolonged vigil. The night sounds were few enough just now in the
northern wilderness. The flies and mosquitoes were no longer the
burden they were in summer. The frigid night seemed to have
silenced their hum, as it had silenced most other sounds. The
voice of the sluggish river alone went on with that soothing
monotony which would continue until the final freeze-up.</p>

<p class='c010'>But Wilder was alert in every fibre. He had reason to be. For
all the silence he knew there was movement going on. Secret
movement which would have to be dealt with before the night was
out. His ears had long since detected it. They had detected it on
the river, both going down and returning. And imagination had
supplied interpretation. Now he was awaiting that development he
felt would surely come.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had not long to wait. A sound of moccasined feet padding
over the loose gravel of the river bed suddenly developed. It was
approaching him. And he strained in the darkness for a vision of
his visitor. After awhile a shadowy outline took definite shape.
It was of the tall, burly figure of a man coming up from the
water’s edge.</p>

<p class='c010'>He came rapidly, and without a word he took his place at the
opposite side of the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill made no move. He offered no greeting. He understood. It
was the thing he had looked for and prepared for. It was Usak.
And he watched the Indian as he laid his long rifle across his
knees, and held out his hands to the crackling blaze.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian seemed in no way concerned with the coolness of his
reception. It was almost as if his actions were an expression of
the thing he considered his simple right. And having taken up his
position he returned the silent scrutiny of his host with eyes so
narrowed that they revealed nothing but the fierce gleam of the
firelight they reflected.</p>

<p class='c010'>He leant forward and deliberately spat into the fire. Then the
sound of his voice came, and his eyes widened till their coal
black depths revealed something of the savage mood that lay
behind them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see him, all thing this night,” he said. “So I come. I,
Usak, say him this thing. I tell ’em all peoples white-mans no
good. Whitemans steal ’em all thing. White-mans him look, look
all time. Him look on the face of white girl. Him talk plenty
much. Him show her much thing. Gold? Yes. Him buy her, this
whiteman. Him buy her with gold which he steal from her
land.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He raised one lean brown hand and thrust up three fingers.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I tak him this gun,” he went on fiercely. “Him ready to my
eye. One—two—three time I so stand. You dead all time so I mak
him. Now I say you go. One day. You not go? Then I mak ’em so
kill quick.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder moved. But it was only to withdraw his hand from the
pocket of his pea-jacket. He was grasping an automatic pistol of
heavy calibre. He drew up a knee in his lolling position, and
rested hand and weapon upon it. The muzzle was deliberately
covering the broad bosom of the man beyond the fire, and his
finger was ready to compress on the instant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right, Usak,” he said calmly. “What are we going
to do? Talk or—shoot?” His eyes smiled in the calm fashion out of
which he was rarely disturbed. “I’m no Euralian man to leave you
with the drop on me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The final thrust was not without effect. For an instant the
Indian’s eyes widened further. Then they narrowed suddenly to the
cat-like watchfulness his manner so much resembled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We talk,” he said, after a brief conflict with his angry
mood, his gaze on the ready automatic whose presence and whose
offence he fully appreciated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s better,” he said. Then he went on after a pause. “Say
boy, if you’d been a whiteman I’d have shot you in your darn
tracks for the thing you just said, and the thing you kind of
hinted at. I had you covered right away as you came along up. But
you’re an Indian. An’ more than that you belong to Marty Le Gros’
lone Kid. You’ve raised her, an’ acted father an’ mother to her,
an’ you guess the sun just rises an’ sets in her. I’m glad. An’
I’m glad ther’ isn’t to be any fool shooting—yet. But, anyway,
when ther’ is I want you to get a grip on this. I’m right in the
business, an’ I’ve got your darn ole gun a mile beaten. I guess
that makes things clear some, an’ we can get busy with our
talk.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian made no reply, but there was a flicker of the
eyelid, and an added sparkle in the man’s eyes as he listened to
the whiteman’s scathing words.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill suddenly sat up and clasped his hands about his knees
while the automatic pistol was thrust even more prominently.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, Usak,” he went on, in the same quiet fashion, but with
a note of conciliation in his tone. “You’re guessing all sorts of
fool Indian things about that gal coming along up here to my
camp. You talk of buying her with the gold I’ve stolen from her.
If you’d been the man you guess you are you’d have got around,
and sat in an’ heard all the talk of the whole thing. But you’re
an Indian man, a low grade boy that guesses to steal around on
the end of a gun, ready to play any dirty old game. No. Keep cool
till I’ve done.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s gun was raised ever so slightly, and he waited while
the leaping wrath of the Indian subsided. He nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s better,” he went on quickly. “You got to listen till
I’m done. I’m goin’ to tell you things, not because I’m scared a
cent of you, but because you’ve been good to the Kid, and you’re
loyal, an’ maybe someday you’re going to feel that way to me.
See? But right away I want you to get this into your fool head. I
came along for two reasons to Caribou. One was to locate Marty Le
Gros’ gold, an’ pass it over to the gal who belongs to it, an’
the other was to marry Felice Le Gros, the same as her father
married her mother, an’ you, I guess, in your own fashion,
married Pri-loo, who the Euralians killed for you. Now you get
that? I don’t want the Kid’s gold, or land, or farm. They cut no
ice with me. I’m so rich I hate the sight of gold. But I want the
Kid. I want to marry her and take her right away where the sun
shines and the world’s worth living in. Where she won’t need to
worry for food or trade, an’ won’t need to wear reindeer buckskin
all the time. And anyway won’t have to live the life of a
white-Indian.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The keen gaze of the whiteman held the Indian fast. There was
no smile in his eyes. But there was infinite command and frank
honesty. Usak stirred uneasily. It was an expression of the
reaction taking place in him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Him marry my good boss, Kid?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The savage had gone out of the man’s tone. The narrowed eyes
had widened, and a curious shining light filled them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You give him all him gold? The gold of my good boss, Marty?”
he went on, as though striving for conviction that he had heard
aright. “Sure? You mak him this? You not mak back to Placer wher’
all him white-woman live? You want only him Kid, same lak Usak
want him Pri-loo all time? Only him Kid? Yes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded with a dawning smile.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You big man all much gold?” the Indian went on urgently. “You
not mak want him gold of the good boss, Marty?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill shook his head and his smile deepened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess I just want the—Kid,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian moved. He laid his rifle aside as though it had
suddenly become a hateful thing he desired to spurn. Then he
reached out, thrusting a hand across the fire to grip that of the
whiteman.</p>

<p class='c010'>But no response was forthcoming. Bill remained motionless with
his hands about his knees and his weapon thrusting. Usak waited a
moment. Then his hand was sharply withdrawn. His quick
intelligence was swift to realise the deliberate slight. But that
which the crude savage in him had no power to do was to remain
silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You not shake by the hand?” he said doubtfully. “You say all
’em good thing by the Kid? It all mush good. Oh, yes. Yet you—”
He broke off and a great light of passion suddenly leapt to his
black eyes. “Tcha!” he cried. “What is it this? The tongue speak
an’ him heart think mush. No, no!” he went on with growing
ferocity. “The good boss, Marty, say heap plenty. Him tell ’em
Indian man all time. Him whitemans no shake, then him not mean
the thing him tongue say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You’re dead wrong, Usak. Plumb wrong. That’s not the reason I
don’t guess to grip your hand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill’s gaze was compelling. There was that in it which denied
the other’s accusations in a fashion that even the mind of the
savage could not fail to interpret.</p>

<p class='c010'>The anger in the Indian’s eyes died down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Indian man’s hand good so as the white man,” he said. “Yet
him not shake so this thing is mush good. This Kid. Him mak wife
to you. You give her all thing good plenty. So. That thing you
say big. Usak give her all, too. Usak think lak she is the child
of Pri-loo. Usak love him good boss, Marty, her father. Oh, yes.
All time plenty. Usak fight, kill. All him life no thing so him
Kid only know good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill inclined his head. The man was speaking out of the depth
of his fierce heart, and he warmed to the simple sturdiness of
his graphic pleading.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know all that,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then—?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian’s hand was slowly, almost timidly thrust towards
him again. But the movement remained uncompleted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Usak,” Bill began deliberately, and in the tone of a purpose
arrived at. “I know you for the good feller you’ve been to all
these folk. I know you better than I guess even they know you. I
guess it don’t take me figgering to know if I’d hurt a soul of
them you’d never quit till you’d shot me to pieces. I know all
that. Let it go at that. A whiteman grips the other feller by the
hand when he knows the things back of that other feller’s mind.
Do you get that? Ther’s a mighty big stain of blood on the hand
you’re askin’ me to grip, an’ I’m not yearning to shake the hand
of a—murderer.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The men were gazing eye to eye. The calm cold of Wilder’s grey
eyes was inflexible. The Indian’s had lit with renewed fire. But
his resentment, the burning fires of his savage bosom were no
match for the whiteman’s almost mesmeric power. The gaze of the
black eyes wavered. Their lids slowly drooped, as though the
search of the other’s was reading him through and through and he
desired to avoid them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The whiteman’s challenge came with patient determination.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian drew a deep breath. Then he nodded slowly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I tell him all thing,” he said simply.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder released his knees and spread himself out on the
ground, and almost ostentatiously returned his pistol to his
pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Go ahead,” he said, as he propped himself on his elbow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak talked at long length in his queer, broken fashion. His
mind was flung back to those far-off years when the great
avenging madness had taken possession of him. He told the story
of Marty Le Gros from its beginning. He told the story of the
man’s great hopes and strivings for the Eskimo he looked upon as
children. He told of the birth of the Kid, and the ultimate death
of the missionary’s wife. Then had come the time of his boss’s
gold “strike,” the whereabouts of which he kept secret even from
him, Usak. Then came the time of the murderous descent of the
Euralians, and the killing and burning that accompanied it. And
how he had returned to the Mission to find the dead remains of
Pri-loo his wife, and of his good boss, Marty, and the living
child flung into the wood which sheltered its home.</p>

<p class='c010'>He told how he went mad with desire to kill, and set out to
wreak his vengeance. He had long since by chance discovered where
these people hid themselves in the far-off mountains, and he went
there, and waited until they returned from their war trail.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now for the first time Wilder learned all the intimate details
of the terrible slaughter which this single savage had contrived
to inflict. Nor did the horror of the story lose in the man’s
telling. He missed nothing of it, seeming to revel in a riot of
furious memory. Once or twice, as he gloated over the fall of an
enemy, he reached out, and his lean hand patted the butt of his
queer old rifle almost lovingly. And with the final account of
his struggle with the leader himself, even Wilder shrank before
the merciless joy the man displayed as he contemplated the end of
the battle with the man’s sockets emptied of the tawny eyes that
had gazed upon the murder of those poor, defenceless creatures
the Indian had been powerless to protect.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, yes,” he said in conclusion. “Him see nothing more,
never. Him have no eyes never no more. Him live, yes. I leave him
woman. So I go. So I come back. I come back to the little Kid,
him good boss, Marty, leave. I live. Oh, yes. I live for him Kid.
I mak big work for him Kid. Big trade. So him grow lak the tree,
him flower, an’ I think much for him. It all good. It mak me feel
good all inside. Him to me lak the child of Pri-loo. You marry
him Kid? Good. You give him gold? Good. Usak plenty happy. Now I
mak him one big trip. Then no more. Then I do so as the good
whiteman of him Kid say. Yes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian spread out his hands in a final gesture. Then he
drew up his knees, and clasped them tightly, while his burning
eyes dwelt broodingly upon the leaping fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why this trip?” Bill’s question came sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian raised his eyes. Then they dropped again to the
fire and he shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You won’t tell me? Why?” Bill demanded again. “Ther’s no need
for any trip. Ther’s work right here for you, for all. Ther’s
gold, plenty, which you can share. Why?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again came the Indian’s shake of the head. His eyes were
raised again for a moment and Bill read and interpreted the
brooding light that gazed out of them. The man seemed about to
speak, but his hard mouth tightened visibly, and again he
stubbornly shook his head and returned to his contemplation of
the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly Bill sprang to his feet and held out his hand. In an
instant the Indian was on his feet, and his dark face was even
smiling. His tenacious hand closed over that of the whiteman.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s all right, Usak,” Bill said quietly. “I’m glad to take
your hand. You’re a big man. You’re a big Indian savage. But
you’re a good man, anyway. Get right back to your shanty now, an’
take that darn old gun with you. You don’t need that fer shooting
me up, anyway. Just keep it—to guard the Kid, and those others.
Just one word before you go. Marty kept his gold secret. You keep
it secret, too, until the Kid lets you speak. I’ve got to make a
big trip to secure the claims before we can talk. When I done
that talk don’t matter. Say, an’ not a word to the Kid of our
talk. Not one word. I want to marry her. And being white folk
it’s our way to ask the girl first. See? I haven’t asked her yet.
An’ if you were to boost in your spoke, maybe she’d get angry,
and—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Usak savee.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Indian was grinning in a fashion that left the whiteman
satisfied. Their hands fell apart, and Usak picked up his gun.
Then he turned away without another word and the night swallowed
him up.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder stood gazing after him, There was no smile in his eyes.
He was thinking hard. And his thought was of that one, big, last
trip the Indian had threatened to make.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>Bill Wilder and Chilcoot moved slowly up from the
water’s edge. The outlook was grey and the wind was piercing. The
river behind them was ruffled out of its usual oily calm, and the
two small laden canoes, lying against the bank, and the final
stowing of which the men had been engaged upon, were rocking and
straining at their raw-hide moorings.</p>

<p class='c010'>The change of season was advancing with that suddenness which
drives the northern man hard. Still, however, the first snow had
not yet fallen, although for days the threat of it had hung over
the world. The ground was iron hard with frost, and each morning
a skin of ice stretched out on the waters of the river from the
low, shelving banks. But the grip of it was not permanent. There
was still melting warmth in the body of the stream, and, each
day, the ice yielded up its hold.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was three days since the camp had witnessed the gathering
of children about its camp fire. Three days which Bill had
devoted to those preparations, careful in the last detail, for
the rush down to Placer before the world was overwhelmed by the
long winter terror. Now, at last, all was in readiness for the
start on the morrow. All, that is, but the one important matter
of Red Mike’s return to camp. Until that happened the start would
have to be delayed.</p>

<p class='c010'>Everything had been planned with great deliberation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Clarence McLeod had even been called upon to assist, in view
of the race against time which the task these men had set
themselves represented. Three days ago he had been despatched up
the river to recall the Irishman. His immediate return was looked
for. Chilcoot had hoped for it earlier. But this third day was
allowed as a margin in case the gold instinct had carried Mike
farther afield than was calculated.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last of the brief day was almost gone. And only a belt of
grey daylight was visible in the cloud banks to the south-west.
Half way up to the camp Wilder paused and gazed out over the
ruffled water, seeking to discover any sign of the man’s return
in the darkening twilight. He stood beating his mitted hands
while Chilcoot passed on up to the camp fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no sign, no sound. And a feeling of keen
disappointment took possession of the expectant man. So much
depended on Mike’s return. Under ordinary circumstances the
season was not the greatest concern, and Wilder would have been
content enough to wait. But the circumstances were by no means
ordinary. There was that lying back of his mind which disturbed
him in a fashion he was rarely disturbed. And it was a thought
and concern he had imparted to no one, not even to his loyal
partner, Chilcoot.</p>

<p class='c010'>He moved on up to the camp, and the keenness of his
disappointment displayed itself in his eyes, and in the tone of
his voice as he conveyed the result of his search to his
comrade.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a dam sight of ’em,” he said peevishly.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had halted at the fire over which Chilcoot was endeavouring
to encourage some warmth into his chilled fingers. He removed his
mitts and held his hands to the blaze.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was kind of wondering,” he went on, “about that boy,
Clarence. Maybe he’s hit up against things. Maybe—Say—”</p>

<p class='c010'>A faint, far-off echo came down stream. It was a call. A
familiar cry in a voice both men promptly recognised. Chilcoot
grinned.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s Mike,” he said. Then he added: “Sure as hell.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder breathed a deep sigh of relief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m glad. I’m mighty thankful,” he exclaimed with a short
laugh. “We’ll be away to-morrow after all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot eyed his companion speculatively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I hadn’t worried fer that,” he said. “Guess we can’t make
Placer in open weather.” He shrugged a pair of shoulders that
were enormous under his fur parka. “It’ll be dead winter ’fore
we’re haf way. It’ll be black night in two weeks, anyway. The big
river don’t freeze right over till late winter, but ther’ll be
ice floes ’most all the way. I can’t see a day more or less is
going to worry us a thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill was searching the heart of the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The Hekor don’t freeze right up easy,” he went on. “That’s
so. But it’ll sure be black night.” Then he looked up, and
Chilcoot recognised his half smile of contentment. “It don’t
matter anyway. The thing’s worth it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What thing?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why the jump we’re making.”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was a brief pause. Then Chilcoot’s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You scared of the winter trail, Bill?” he asked quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The older man nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would ha’ been the first time in your life,” he said.
“I’ve seen you take the chances of a crazy man.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>“Don’t it beat Hell?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Irishman had listened to the story of the “strike” and sat
raking his great fingers through the thick stubble of flaming
beard he had developed, and grinned first across at his chief,
Bill Wilder, then at the twinkling, deep-set eyes of
Chilcoot.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were all gathered about the fire, that centre of
everything to the northern man. The youth Clarence was sprawled
full length on the ground, happy in the thought that he was
playing his part in the great game on which these men were
engaged. He was content to listen while the others talked. But he
drank in every word with the appetite of healthy youth, digesting
and learning as his young mind so ardently desired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ it’s rich? Full o’ the stuff?” Mike’s lips almost smacked
as he persisted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So full you’ll get a nightmare reckonin’ it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot nodded while his eyes sparkled. Mike drew a deep
breath. The two summers behind them looked like a happy picnic
instead of the months of wasted endeavour they had seemed to his
impetuous soul.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ther’s more than a hundred claims on it we know of,” Bill
said soberly. “Maybe ther’s miles of it up that queer, crazy
stream. We haven’t worried farther. The stakes are in fer the
whole of our bunch, an’ the folks across the water. That’s as far
as we’re concerned. We’re beating it to Placer to-morrow to
register. Say,” he went on impressively, “ther’ll be a rush like
the days of ’98, and we can’t take chances. If the thing’s like
what I guess we’ll cheapen gold worse than the Yukon boom did.
Does it hit you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Between the eyes.” Mike laughed out of his boisterous
feelings. “We ken get the bunch right down, an’ get a dump of
stuff out before the freeze-up,” he went on eagerly. “What’s it
to be? A pool or claim work?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ther’s goin’ to be no pool. An’ ther’s goin’ to be no rake
over till spring.” Wilder’s tone was decided, and the grin died
out of the Irishman’s eyes. “I told you we’re takin’ no chances.
Chilcoot and I have planned this thing right out. Of the three
best claims we’re sure about, one is yours. But you don’t pan an
ounce of soil till the register’s made, and you’ve got your
‘brief.’ Then it’s yours on your own, the same as the others
belong to each of the other folk. An’ you can work how you darn
please. But you won’t see the place, even, till we get right back
from Placer. An’ the boys aren’t hearing a word of it till
spring. It’s this I sent Clarence, here, up to get you around
for. I want you to sit tight, right here, till we get back with
the whole thing fixed. It’s worth waiting for, Mike. It’s so good
you just haven’t figgers enough in your fool head to count your
luck. You’ll act this way, boy. I promised you haf a million
dollars if you hit back to Placer without a colour. That still
goes, but you won’t need a thing from me. You’ll play our hand
right?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Mike’s disappointment was all the keener for his mercurial
temperament, but he nodded readily and Wilder was satisfied.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure I’ll play it right, the way you want it. But I don’t see
we need act like ther’ was spooks around waitin’ to jump in on us
before the register’s fixed.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder smiled back at the protesting man.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But ther’ are,” he said. “If you’d the experience I’ve had of
this blamed old North you’d be scared to death for our ‘strike.’
It’s a ghost-haunted country this, and most of the spooks have
got a kind of wireless of their own that ’ud beat anything we
Christian folk ever heard tell of. Ther’s six months of winter
ahead, and most of that we’ll be on the trail, or fixing things.
It just needs one half-breed pelt hunter to get wise to the game
happening around, or a stray bunch of Euralian murderers, and
we’d have haf the north on us before the Commissioner could sign
our ‘briefs.’ No, boy, get it from me, and just sit around till
daylight comes again, an’ dream of the hooch you’re going to
drink to the luck of the Kid. It’s the Kid’s luck that’s handed
us this thing. It’s the luck her father reckoned was to be hers.
And by no sort of crazy act are we going to queer it. I’m taking
your scow, and beating it down stream. Clarence’ll feel like
gettin’ to home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The grinning eyes of Mike followed the tall figure of his
leader, with the youth, Clarence, striding beside him, as it
vanished in the darkness on its way to the water’s edge. And as
they passed from view he turned to the man who displayed no
desire to quit the comfort of the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’d guessed he’d fallen for it two summers back,” he said.
“You can locate it with both eyes shut, an’ cotton batten stuffed
in your brain box. That gal had him fast by the back of the neck
on sight. The Kid, eh? It’s not Bill Wilder’s way of playing safe
on a gold ‘strike.’ That gal’s got him scared to death for the
plum he guesses to hand her. No, sirree,” he went on, with a
shake of his disreputable head, “the Jezebels o’ Placer for mine,
an’ a bunch o’ hooch you could drown a battleship in. It’s easy
game that don’t hand you a nightmare, if it’s liable to empty
your sack o’ dust. That Kid! What’s he goin’ to do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot shrugged. Mike was not the man he felt like opening
out to.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He ain’t crazy enough to—marry her?” Mike went on
contemptuously. “No. He’s no fool kid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A deep flush mounted to the veteran’s temples. His deepset
eyes sparkled as he surveyed the other through the smoke of the
fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You best ask Bill the things you want to know,” he said
coldly. “It don’t matter what you think. It don’t matter what any
darn fool thinks. Bill’s mostly spent his life playin’ the game
as he sees it. An’ I guess he’ll go right on doin’ the same. And
the game he plays is a right game. An’ he’s as ready to hand it
out to a hooch-soused no-account, as he is to a gal with a dandy
pair of blue eyes.”</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>It had been a quiet, almost subdued evening at the homestead.
Somehow Bill Wilder’s manner had been graver than was its wont,
and these simple folk, who, since his re-discovery of Marty Le
Gros’ gold “strike,” had so quickly come to regard him as
something in the nature of the arbiter of their destinies, had
been clearly affected by his change of manner.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had shared their supper, and listened to Clarence’s story
of his search for Red Mike. He had found it easier to listen than
to talk. Hesther, too, had spent her time in listening, while the
children chattered all unconscious of the real mood of their
elders.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the Kid it was a time of quiet happiness, marred only by
the thought that with the first streak of brief daylight on the
morrow this man would be speeding on his race with the season to
ensure her own, and the good fortunes of all those she loved.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl looked forward to the coming months of winter
clarkness without any glimmer of that happy, contented philosophy
which had always been hers. Looking ahead the whole prospect
seemed so dark and empty. The days since Bill’s coming to the
Caribou had been so overflowing, so thrilling with happy events
and delirious joy that the contrasting prospect was only the more
deplorably void. And with all the untamed spirit in her she
rebelled at the coming parting.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet she understood the necessity. She realised the enormous
stake he was playing for on their behalf, and so she was
determined that no act or word of hers should hinder him. There
had been moments when the impulse to plead permission to
accompany him was almost irresistible. It filled her heart with
delighted dreams of displaying, for his appreciation, her skill
and sturdy nerve on the winter trail. She felt that for all her
sex she could easily accept more than her due share of the
labour, and could increase his comfort a hundredfold. But in
sober moments she knew it could not be. If nothing else the woman
instinct in her forbade it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl never for one moment paused to question her feelings.
Why should she? The life she knew, the life she had always lived,
had left her free of every convention which encompasses a woman’s
life in civilization. Bill Wilder had leapt into her life as her
dream man. He was her all in all, the whole focus of her simple
heart. Why then should she deny it? Why then should she attempt
to blind herself? There had been no word of love between them. It
almost seemed unnecessary. She loved his steady grey eyes, with
their calm smile. She revelled in his unfailing, kindly
confidence. His spoken word was always sufficient, backed as it
was by his great figure, so full of manhood’s youthful strength.
Then he was of her own country. That vast Northland which claimed
their deepest affection for all its terror. Oh, yes, she loved
him with her whole soul and body. And her love inspired the
surging rebellion which her sturdy sense refused outlet or
display.</p>

<p class='c010'>No. She had long since learned patience. It was the thing her
country taught her as surely as anything on earth. Besides, the
planning was all Bill’s. Every detail had been weighed and
measured by him. Even it was his veto that had been set on her
own journey for trade. He had urged its abandonment, demanding
both her and Usak’s presence on the river during his absence. So
it must be.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the girl this last evening together passed all too
swiftly. Much of the time, while the others chattered, she
remained scarcely heeding sufficiently to respond intelligently
to the occasional appeals made to her. And then, when the time
came for Bill’s going, she rose quickly from her seat beside the
stove and slipped her fur parka over her buckskin clothing. She
regarded the privilege she contemplated as her right.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther observed, but wisely refrained from comment. But her
children were less merciful. Perse grinned impishly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wher’ you goin’, Kid?” he demanded.</p>

<p class='c010'>The ready mother instantly leapt to the girl’s assistance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lightin’ Bill to the landin’,” she said sharply. “Which the
scallawag menfolk around this shanty don’t seem yearnin’ to
do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She don’t need to,” Clarence protested.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Don’t she?” The mother laughed. “You’re too late, boy. Guess
Bill, here, ’ud hate to be lit by folks who need reminding the
thing’s due. You boys beat it to your blankets. Kid’ll see Bill
on his way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man was ready. He bulked tremendously under the thick fur
of his outer clothing. He pulled his fur cap low down on his
head, while the Kid lit the queer old hurricane lamp with a
burning brand from the stove. Hesther’s diminutive figure was
further dwarfed beside him as she prepared to make her
farewell.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’ll be quite a piece before you get along again,” she said,
in a voice that was not quite steady. And the man laughed shortly
for all there seemed no reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I just can’t figger how soon before I’m along back,” he said.
“I’d like to fix it, but it wouldn’t be reasonable anyway. You
see, mam,” he went on, his gaze turned on the girl who shut the
lamp with a slam, “Gold Commissioners have their ways, and sort
of make their own time. And though I reckon to pull some wires I
can’t say when I’ll get through. And then ther’s always the
winter trail. But I’ll sure be along back before the spring
break.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His gaze came back to the little woman who was regarding him
with wistful eyes of affection, as though he were one of her own
boys, and he thrust out a hand which was instantly clasped
between both her rough palms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I just got to be back then,” he went on. “And when I come you
can gamble I got things fixed so tight you’ll only need to sit
around and act the way I tell you.” He smiled down into the misty
brown eyes. “You keep a right good fire, mam,” he said gently.
“Ther’s no trouble for you while I’m gone. Mike’s not a thing but
a nightmare to look at, but he’s got clear orders while Chilcoot
and I are on the trail. And he’ll put ’em through to the limit.
You won’t need for a thing he can hand you. So long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The mist in the mother’s eyes had developed into real tears,
and they overflowed down her worn cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God bless you, Bill,” she stammered, as she released his hand
with obvious reluctance. “I’ll sure do my best. I just can’t say
the things in here,” she went on, clasping her thin bosom with
both hands. Then she struggled to smile. “Guess we’ll all be
countin’ up till you get back, an’ it can’t be a day sooner than
we’re all wishin’. So long, boy.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill turned to the elder children who had remained to speed
him on his way and nodded comprehensively.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So long, folks,” he said. “See you again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He passed quickly to the door, where the Kid was awaiting him,
and moved out. And a final glance back revealed Hesther framed in
the open doorway, with the yellow light of the room behind her,
silhouetting her fragile figure, as she waved a farewell in the
direction of the swinging lantern.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The Kid’s pretty blue eyes were raised to the smiling face
looking down into hers. It was a moment tense with feeling. It
was that moment of parting when she felt that all sense of joy,
all sense of happiness was to be snuffed right out of her life.
And the responsive smile she forced to her eyes was perilously
near to tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>The lantern in her hand revealed the canoe hauled up against
the crude landing. Its rays found reflection in the dark spread
of water where a skin of ice was already forming, seeking to
embed the frail craft at its mooring.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was little enough relief from the darkness under the
heavy night clouds. There was no visible moon. That was screened
behind the stormy threat, yet it contrived a faint twilight over
the world. Not a single star was to be seen anywhere and the
ghostly northern lights were deeply curtained.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now, in these last moments of parting, the youth in Bill
Wilder was once more surging with impulse. As he gazed down into
the bravely smiling eyes a hundred desires were beating in his
brain. And he yearned desperately to fling every caution to the
winds and abandon himself to the love which left him without a
thought but of the delight with which the Kid’s presence filled
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Somehow it seemed to his big nature a wanton cruelty that this
girl should be charged with the cares of a struggle for existence
in this far-flung northern wilderness. Perhaps as great a feeling
as any that stirred him at this moment was a desire to relieve
her of the last shadow of anxiety in the monstrous season about
to descend upon them. And yet he was compelled to leave her to
face alone the very hardships he would have saved her from. And
this with an acute understanding of the uncertainty of the
outcome of the thing he had planned to accomplish in the darkness
of the long winter night. For once in his life his usual
confidence was undermined by curious forebodings. But he gave no
outward sign, while he listened to the urgent little story the
girl had to tell of the Indian Usak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He’s a queer feller,” he said thoughtfully. Then he added:
“You told him clear out ther’s to be no trading trip to Placer?
An’ still he’s making ready a trip?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl laughed shortly. There was no mirth in it. It was a
little nervous expression of feeling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You just can’t get back of that feller’s mind,” she said.
“Usak’s dead obstinate. He’s obstinate as a young bull caribou
when he feels like it. It was when I told him it was your plan we
shouldn’t make Placer. I sort of read it in his queer black eyes,
even though he took the order without a kick. Maybe he was
disappointed. You see, he’s got that swell black fox. Next day I
found him fixing for a trip on his own. I asked him right away
about it, an’ his answer left me worried an’ guessing. ‘That all
right,’ he said, ‘I know us not mak Placer. So. Then I mak one
big trip.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s imitation of the Indian’s broken talk brought a
deepening smile to Bill’s eyes for all the concern her story
inspired.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I told him right away you guessed it best for him to stop
around,” she went on. “An’ it was then he got mulish. He snapped
me like an angry wolf. ‘Who this whiteman say I not mak big trip?
Him not all thing, this man. No. I mak big trip.’ He went right
on fixing his outfit after that and wouldn’t say another word.
He’s right up ther’ in his shanty now. I saw the lamp burning as
we came down. He means to go his trip, and-”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing’s goin’ to stop him.” The man’s jaws shut with a
snap. “He’s surely got a mule beat.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He remained buried in deep thought for some moments while the
girl watched him, wondering anxiously at his interpretation of
Usak’s attitude. She was filled with an unease she could not
shake off.</p>

<p class='c010'>Quite suddenly Bill’s manner underwent a change. He laughed
quietly, and his gaze, which had passed to the dark river came
again to the troubled face beside him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just don’t worry a thing, Kid,” he said, with an assumption
of lightness which drew a responsive sigh of relief. “It don’t
matter. Ther’s the boys around, and Mike, and my bunch. Usak’s
full of his own notions, an’ it’s best not to drive him too hard.
If he guesses to make a trip, just let him beat it. No. Don’t you
worry a thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid sighed again. And the man understood that the comfort
he had desired for her had been achieved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Again came his quiet laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Anyway we can’t worry with Usak—to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl shook her head. In a moment she had forgotten the
Indian and remembered only the thing about to happen. It was
their farewell that had yet to be spoken, and this man would be
speeding up the darkened river to his camp, and it would be
months—long, dreary months before she would witness again those
calm smiling grey eyes, and hear again the voice that somehow
made the heaviest burdens of her life on the river something that
was a joy to contemplate. The desolation of his going appalled
her now that the moment of parting had actually arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Gee! It’s going to be a long night to—Spring.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill spoke with a surge of feeling he could no longer
deny.</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl remained silent, and her blue eyes sought the dark
course of the river in self-defence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“What’ll you be doing—all the time?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill’s voice had lowered. There was a wonderful depth of
tenderness in its tone.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waitin’—mostly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a little wistful, a little desperate. For the first
time the girl’s voice had become unsteady.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Waiting?”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned swiftly in the shadow that hid them up. His eyes
were no longer calm. They were hot with those passions which are
only the deeper and stronger for the strong man’s restraint.
Suddenly he thrust a hand into the bosom of his parka and
withdrew the folded plans of Marty Le Gros’ gold “strike.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Here, Kid,” he said urgently. “You best have these. They’re
yours anyway whatever happens. You never can guess in this queer
old country. Take ’em in case. I’ll sure get right back in the
spring. If I don’t you’ll just have to figger—I can’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He waited for the girl to take the paper. But she only gazed
round on him with eyes that had widened in real terror.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You mean you’ll be—dead?” There was an instant’s pause as
though the thought had paralysed her. Then a piteous cry broke
from her. “Oh, no, no, no!” she cried. “You’ll come back, Bill.
You won’t let a thing kill you. I want you, Bill. You’ll come
back to me. Oh, say you will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a distracted face that was raised to his with widened
eyes that had filled with tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Would it hurt if—I didn’t?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man had moved a step nearer.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just for one instant the tearful eyes stared up at him. Then
the threatened storm broke. The lantern clattered to the ground
and extinguished itself, and the girl’s face was buried in her
mitted hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sight of her distress was unendurable. The man no longer
had power to deny himself. Impulse leapt from under all
restraint. That wonderful impulse that is the very essence of the
human soul, the inspiration of all life. He caught her up in his
fur-clad arms, and held her crushed against a heart leaping madly
with the triumph of glowing manhood.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The grey daylight was still faint over the south-eastern
horizon. It was growing slowly, transforming the darkened world
under a grey twilight that was hard set to dispel the night
shadows. Still it was daylight, and just sufficient to serve as a
reminder that behind the drear Arctic winter lay the promise of
ultimate golden day.</p>

<p class='c010'>The teeming rapids lay ahead, a cauldron of furiously boiling
waters, and away beyond them the stately course of the Hekor
River. To the south lay the wide woodland bluff that had
witnessed the years-old tragedy of Marty Le Gros’ home, flinging
deep shadows across the turbulent waters. While to the north, far
as the eye could see, lay the low lichen-grown land rollers
inclining gently away to the purple distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder and Chilcoot had pulled in to the northern bank.
Their two light canoes were moored just at the head of the
narrow, deep, swift channel down to the greater river, which was
the only open passage through the boiling rapids. They were made
fast to an up-standing boulder, and the men were afoot on the
shore, gazing down at their outfit, and engaged in earnest
talk.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot was listening for the moment while his thoughtful
eyes searched anywhere but in the direction of the purposeful
face of his friend. And Wilder was talking rapidly and with a
decision that forbade all protest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Old friend, ther’s just one thing I don’t want from you now,”
he said. “That’s any sort of old kick. Maybe I’m handing you
reason enough to set you kicking like a crazy steer. But you
won’t do it, boy, for the sake of all the years we’ve ground at
the queer old mill of life together. You’re the one feller, the
only feller, I look to to help me along when I’m set neck deep in
a tight hole, and if you fail me I’ll have to squeal on the thing
above all others that seems right to me. I gave a promise, and
I’ve got to make that promise good if it beats the life out of
me, and robs me of all that little gal back there means to me.
I’m going right up the big river to the Valley of the Fire Hills,
while you get right on down to Placer, and pull every darn wire
in my name and your own to fix the ‘strike’ right. Later I’m
gambling to get along down and join you, if this darn country
don’t beat the life out of me. I’ve got to go if hell freezes
over. Ther’s a helpless woman, and a blinded man right up there,
and if I don’t make ’em first they’ll be murdered by a savage
who’s just stark mad to slaughter ’em. They’re the folk I got the
plans of the ‘strike’ from. And I got it on a sort of promise I’d
see no harm got around their way from the feller who hates ’em so
he’d beat his way out of the gates of hell to get after ’em.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Usak.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The bright eyes of the older man searched his friend’s.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ that’s why you split the outfit into two boats?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is he settin’ right out? You got to beat him on the
river?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was sharp doubt in Chilcoot’s question.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill nodded again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes.” Then he laughed mirthlessly. “I got to beat it up that
river as if all the legions of hell were hard on my heels. Say,
boy, I got to beat the hardest trail man around the North, with a
crazy eye running over levelled sights. I’ve got to beat him and
I’ve got to beat the winter night. I just don’t know a thing how
it’s to be done, but if I don’t do it I’ll have broke my fool
word—which ’ud break me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot’s gaze was turned up the river in the direction of
the queer homestead whose simple dwellers had flung them their
farewell as they passed down on their journey in the
darkness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“An’ that little gal, Bill,” he said slowly. “That little gal
you reckon to take right out of here, an’ marry, an’ educate, an’
set around in a land of sunshine to raise your dandy kids. Ain’t
ther’ a promise there that it’ll break you to fail in? Are you
feelin’ like makin’ a great give-up for lousy scum of—Euralians?
Are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“There’s sure a promise there, boy, I’ll make good. If I don’t
it’ll only be I’m dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old man shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I jest don’t get the argument,” he said in his blunt fashion.
“If I didn’t know you I’d say you’re dead crazy. But you ain’t,”
he went on, with another shake of the head. “Your promise is the
biggest thing in your life, bigger than that Kid’s happiness.
Maybe you just can’t help it. Maybe none of us ken help the
things we are. I ain’t goin’ to kick. It ain’t my way with you.
I’m goin’ right on down to Placer, an’ I’m goin’ to put things
through, same as if you was along. An’ I’ll wait fer you to come
along till I know you can’t get. Then I’ll get back to here, an’
see the Kid, an’ her folks get the thing you fancy for them, an’
I’ll see ’em along their trail till they can handle their own
play. That goes, Bill. Guess it goes all the time with me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I knew.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s real acknowledgment was in the faint smile that shone
in his eyes. There was no attempt to find words to express
himself. And anyway with Chilcoot there was no need.</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot gazed down at the swaying boats.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will we beat it?” he said, and turned and glanced down the
swift stream.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We best.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was then the older man voiced something of the real feeling
that so deeply stirred his rough heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, Bill, ther’s things in life make a feller wish they
weren’t. You’re bug on a promise, an’ it’s the thing that’s left
you the feller you are in other folks’ minds. I’d make any old
promise, so it suited me, to folks I ain’t worried about. An’ I
wouldn’t lie awake o’ nights breakin’ it. But I ain’t any sort o’
high notions. Japs—Euralians?” he snorted, “Why, I’d promise ’em
the earth with a dandy barbed wire fence set all round it to get
the thing I wanted from ’em. I’d—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not if you’d seen a queer little woman whose worst crime was
giving up her life nursing a blinded devil of a murdering
Euralian husband, and was nigh crazy that some feller was coming
along to rob her of his life. Man, the sight made me sweat pity.
If I can save that poor soul that much, why—I want to do it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill sighed and passed a hand across his broad brow. “It’s no
sort of self-righteousness with me, boy,” he went on. “I just
won’t know an easy moment if I don’t do everything in my power to
beat that crazy Indian. Come on. We’ll get right on. We’ll clear
these rapids and part the other side.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He moved hurriedly down to the water’s edge and began to cast
the moorings adrift. Chilcoot held the canoes ready. In a few
moments both had taken their places, and the thrusting paddles
still held the little vessels against the stream.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill suddenly held out a hand from which the mitt had been
removed, and Chilcoot gripped it forcefully.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We’ll shake right here, old pard,” Bill said quietly. “When
we get below we’ll be full up keeping clear of the popple. You
got everything clear. An’ ther’s nothing on the river to beat
you. I’ll be glad to have your wish of luck.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Their hands fell apart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You sure have it, Bill, all the luck that’s always yours
rolled right up into one.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Chilcoot nodded and his eyes sparkled with real feeling. “So
long,” he cried.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill’s farewell came ringing back as his little craft shot out
into the stream under the plunging stroke of his paddle.</p>

    <div>A WHITEMAN’S WORD</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The grey dawn yielded to the many hues of the
sunrise. For the moment a cloudless azure dome smiled down upon a
world with a soft crystal-white carpet outspread. For days the
temperature had hovered about zero, and ice had formed upon the
waterways with that fierce rapidity which the northern man knows
so well. Its frigid grip was reaching in every direction seeking
to seal the world under iron bonds.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the Valley of the Fire Hills was dripping and steaming.
Everywhere the snow was melting, and the dark waters of the
little river flowed smoothly on still free from the smallest
trace of ice. The temperature was well above freezing, for the
terrestrial furnaces of the blackened hills were banked and
glowing.</p>

<p class='c010'>The valley was dense with a fog of steam. It was a ghostly
world without shape or form. A blind world with only the river
bank to guide the adventurer through its heart. There was no
sound of life for all the coming of the pitiful light of the
briefest day. The world was still, remote, bewildering.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet life was there; staunch, indomitable life. It was there
with purpose, simple, unwavering, and no qualm or doubt marred
the clarity of its resolution. A boat, a small whiteman-built
canoe, was moving up the eastern bank of the stream, feeling
groping, taking every chance so that it made its final
destination.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the first lift of the sun above the horizon a current of
air stirred the fog, and a cold breath shot through the tepid
air. It came and passed. Then it came again with added force. It
was low on the ground and the fog lifted. Swift and keen it
pursued its advantage, and the blinding mist thinned, and a dull
sheen of the risen sun replaced the cold grey. The wind
increased. It bit fiercely as it swept down the heated valley.
And in a moment, it seemed, out of the bewildering fog there
appeared the graceful outline of the nosing canoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder breathed a sigh of relief. At last the scales had
fallen from before his eyes, and his way lay open to him.
Instantly his paddle dipped, and his boat shot out into
midstream. It leapt forward under the mighty thrusts of his arms,
and as it raced on a fervent prayer went up that the wind might
hold and increase in strength.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The canoe lay moored at the old log landing. There had been no
hesitation. No doubt had been entertained for its security.
Wilder had left it to such chances as might befall, his only
means of return to the outer world, while he made his way over
the snow-slush to the shades of the woodlands surrounding the
secret habitation that was his goal.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Half way through the woods the thing Wilder looked for came to
pass. Eyes and ears were keenly alert. He had realised that his
approach would be observed. That seeing eyes, faithful to the
service of the woman’s blinded charge, would be unfailing in
their watch. The terror he had once witnessed in them had been
sufficient to warn him that her life was comparable to that of a
vigilant watchdog, everlastingly searching for the approach of
the dark, avenging figure that hypnotized her with the horror of
its return.</p>

<p class='c010'>The diminutive figure of the Japanese woman came hurriedly to
meet him from her hiding somewhere screened amidst the dull green
foliage of these northern woods. She stood before him, her
slanting black eves widely gazing, and her thin, lined face
eagerly demanding in its expression of scarcely suppressed
agitation.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crysa began at once. She had no fear of this white-man. But
she realised that his coming had to do with her safety and the
safety of her charge. His promise had been her comfort, her most
treasured memory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You give him the paper?” she said, as though no space of time
had elapsed since their last meeting, and the memory of every
word then spoken was as fresh in her mind as though their meeting
had occurred only the day before. “You give him this thing? And
now you come that I may know it is so? And Usak is satisfied? Oh,
yes. You come to say that thing? There is no more fear? None? I
sleep, I eat, I know peace. Usak will not come?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder gripped himself before this poor creature’s
heart-breaking appeal. He knew he must dash her last hope, and
hurl her again to that despair which had beset her so long. It
was useless to attempt to soften the facts. His resolve was clear
in his mind. He shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nothing will satisfy him,” he said sombrely, “but the life of
your man. He’s on his way now, I guess. But I got away first. I
came right along up to get you folks away to safety. I don’t
reckon to know how you’re fixed for a quick get-away. But you
both got to make it right now, or Usak’ll be along and kill you
both up. Maybe I can get you right out of the country back to
your own folk. That’s how I figger. But if I’m to do that you
need to beat it down the river with me—now. I came because of my
promise. See? I’m here with a white-man’s word to do the best I
know. You’ve got to take me to Ukisama, and both of you need to
make up your minds right away. Money don’t need to worry you.
Only outfit for the journey along down to Placer. Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>While he was speaking the woman’s face was a study in
emotions. With his first words the urgent hope fell from her in
one tragic flash. There were no tears. But panic closed down upon
her in a staggering contrast to her hope of the moment before.
The dreadful fear she was enduring left her lips moving. She
followed the man’s words, as though she was repeating them the
more surely to impress them upon her staggered faculties. But a
measure of comfort seemed to come to her as he propounded his
purpose for their safety. And a desperate sort of calm helped her
as he made his final demand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You come with me,” she cried at once. “I take you to Hela.
You say all this thing. I, too, say much. Maybe he go. I not
know. Come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And she turned, and led the way without waiting for any
reply.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Wilder experienced a curious sensation of repugnance as he
entered the presence of the blinded man. He was not usually
troubled by such sensitiveness. But somehow he now realised more
surely than ever contact with something inexpressively evil. The
yellow face of the man was almost grey. But whether it was the
result of any emotion of fear that had produced the noisome hue
he could not tell. The man’s eyeless sockets seemed even more
repulsive than when first he had looked upon them. Then there
were his restlessly moving hands, which, in his blind
helplessness, never for a moment seemed to remain quite
still.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were in the central hall of the house, that Eastern
apartment so full of vivid memories for the whiteman. It was
unchanged from that which he knew of it, even to the dust, and
the sense of neglect and disuse that pervaded it. Wilder
remembered acutely. His eyes passed over every familiar detail of
the place and brought back to him a picture of the happenings of
that night, when, unbidden, unwelcome, he had been a guest in the
house.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blinded man confronted him on his seat upon the cushioned
divan beside the carved screen. And he spoke at once as Bill
entered and moved over to the chair which was set before the
bureau. Crysa went at once to her husband and took her place on
the seat beside him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You come again?” he said in his low, harsh tones.</p>

<p class='c010'>And the challenge warned Wilder of the amazing watchfulness
which fear had inspired in these two. Crysa had said no word as
she entered, yet this sightless man knew him and understood.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder spoke quietly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m here to help you,” he went on. “If you reckon to save the
life remaining to you you’ll need to take my talk at its face
value and make a quick get-away right off. I’ve just handed your
wife, as quick as I could, the trouble beating up the river for
you. Usak’s behind me with his gun. He’s crazy for your blood.
An’ I’m crazy he shan’t get you. I took an almighty chance
pushing up from the Caribou here because I handed your wife a
promise I’d do the best I knew to save the murder that crazy
Indian looks for. With winter closing right down no one can
figger the chances of getting through back. Still, I handed my
word, and it goes with me. The thing I can do is to get you down
to Caribou if the winter don’t queer us. I can get you right on
to your own country, which, seeing you are who and what you are,
is the only thing. Maybe I’ll be going beyond the right I have in
doing this, but I’ll do it because you’re blind and helpless, and
because your wife seems to have suffered enough for being your
wife. There’s going to be no argument as far as I’m concerned.
That I’m a police officer cuts no ice. In this thing I’m just a
plain whiteman who’s given his word, and it goes. Now, here’s the
proposition so far as I’m concerned. I’m going right back to the
landing, and I’ll wait around there till, the daylight goes. If
you come along in that time with the truck you need for the
journey—you needn’t worry with the food, I’ve got all we need—you
have my promise I’ll get you safe through, if its humanly
possible, to your own country. If I fail my life will pay just as
surely as yours. You got my promise, a whiteman’s promise, and
you’ve got to be satisfied with it if you fancy making a
get-away. The moment night closes in I pull out, whether you come
with with me or not. That’s all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The repulsion inspired by the blind man’s presence had a
deeper effect on Wilder than he knew. He had planned his method,
but his planning had not provided for the cold fashion in which
he delivered his proposition. His tone was even more frigid than
he realised. He rose from his seat to depart. And instantly the
Count’s harsh voice stayed him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And how do I know Usak is on the river? How I know this is
not a police trap?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder searched the ghastly features. A surge of anger leapt,
and his cheeks flushed till his broad brow was suffused to the
edge of his thick fur cap.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It don’t matter a thing to me what you know, or what you
don’t know,” he said sharply. “Usak’s on the river, making right
here with his gun. Ther’s a getaway there at the landing till the
daylight goes. You can take it or not. It’s right up to you. It’s
there because murder’s going to happen around, and it’s my notion
to prevent it. You’re blind, and your woman helpless. It don’t
seem to me you matter a hoot in hell. But I’m glad to help a
woman—any woman. You’ll think it over. An’ don’t forget there
isn’t more than two hours before the daylight goes. That’s all
I’ve to say.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned and passed out the way he had come, and as he went
he avoided the dark stains on the floor, those stains so grimly
significant, which even he could not bring himself to pass
over.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Half an hour before the last of the daylight a canoe crept
down to the landing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder was ready to cast off. He had spent the interim in
preparing room in his vessel for the added burden of his
passengers. He knew they would come.</p>

<p class='c010'>There had been no doubt in his mind whatsoever. And curiously
enough, he was the more sure since the man was blind. In his
philosophy the more surely the man was afflicted the more surely
he would cling to life, and dread the final slaughtering of his
body by an unseen enemy. Then in addition there was the urgent
appealing of the little woman, who was surely something more than
a ministering angel to this helpless demon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, yes, he had known they would come, but he had not
suspected the manner of their coming. They came in their own
canoe, the blind man paddling in the bow, and the woman, infinite
in her despairing devotion, serving her man to the last at the
steering paddle.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a display of devotion that thrilled the whiteman for
all the worthlessness of the object of it. And he accepted the
position readily. It might add to his care, but it would lessen
his labours. Their escape from the avenging Usak was all he
desired. But he was by no means blinded to the reason that they
came in their own boat. It was the man’s distrust. He had no
desire to yield himself a possible prisoner in the whiteman’s
craft.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder nodded approval as they drew alongside, and he realised
the considerable outfit, including food, that had been
provided.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You prefer it that way,” he said quietly. “That’s all right.
Keep right on my tail,” he went on, reaching up and casting his
mooring adrift. “It’s mighty dark along the river, an’ maybe
we’ll be thankful it is that way. If it beats you you can make
fast to me. If you’ve sense you’ll act that way. I got two eyes
an’ I know all ther’ is to this darn trail.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He thrust out into the stream, and the second vessel followed
him like a ghostly shadow in the twilight.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>A man sat gazing out from his rocky shelter. His dark eyes
were brooding as he contemplated the falling snow. Below him,
rendered invisible by the storm, lay the still bosom of the
mountain lake with shore ice supporting its white burden. The
bulk of the water still resisted the grip of winter, but with
every passing day, every hour, the spread of shore ice was
encroaching.</p>

<p class='c010'>The grey curtain of falling snow was impenetrable even to the
accustomed eyes of Usak. The world about him was silent, and
windless, and alive with that desolate threat which drives man to
despair. He had reached the mouth of the Valley of the Fire
Hills, and, blinded by the sudden snow-storm, had sought what
shelter he could find.</p>

<p class='c010'>His shelter was half cavern and half overhung in the towering
headland at the mouth of the valley. Yet it served. His kyak was
hauled from the icy water and lay on the foreshore. And the man
sat over a smoulder of fire made of the driftwood he had
collected on his way, and the profusion of lichen he had gathered
from the snow-free shelter in which he sat.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak crouched huddled and smoking, over the inadequate fire.
Its warmth was negligible, but it afforded that without which no
human being in such desolation could endure, a mental comfort and
companionship. He was content to wait. For all the winter was
advancing apace, for all he knew that soon, desperately soon, the
great lake, out upon which he was gazing, would be one broad
sheet of ice many feet in thickness, and impossible for the light
craft which was his vehicle, he was content enough. The Valley of
the Fire Hills would remain unfrozen, and the great river below
him would remain open long enough for his navigation. For the
rest there was always portage. Oh, yes. Time was with him. The
real freeze-up was not yet. The snow would cease later, and
meanwhile he could contemplate the thing he had looked forward to
for so many years.</p>

<p class='c010'>So there was no impatience that the world was blinded by
snowflakes half the size of his brown palm. With the passing of
the silent storm, so still, so windless, doubtless the cold would
increase, but also, doubtless, the sky could clear, and the
Arctic twilight would again light the world with its ghostly
rays.</p>

<p class='c010'>He thrust out a moccasined foot and kicked the embers of his
fire together. He removed the pipe from his strong jaws, and held
its stem to the warmth. The saliva in it had frozen, and it had
gone out.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently he reached down and picked up a live coal. He tossed
it into the pipe bowl and sucked heavily at the stem, belching
clouds of reeking smoke. His enjoyment was profound.</p>

<p class='c010'>After awhile the pipe was neglected. His enjoyment of it was
merged into something more absorbing. His savage mind was lost in
the thing that had brought him to the heart of the great Alaskan
hills, and he was gazing on a vision of savage delight. As his
hands gripped each other about his knees there was movement in
them, nervous, twitching movement. For, in fancy, they were
slowly crushing out the life he was determined should know the
hideous meaning of prolonged death agony.</p>

<p class='c010'>His delight was in his darkly brooding eyes as they looked
into the flicker of the fire. His mind was teeming with the thing
he would say while that life was conscious and could know the
terror and agony of those last moments. Oh, yes. It was worth all
the waiting and he was glad, glad that now, at last, the moment
of his final vengeance was approaching. Sheer insanity was
driving, but it was that calm insanity where the border line is
passed coldly and calmly with hate the dominating influence.
Suddenly he started and leant forward.</p>

<p class='c010'>His hands parted from about his knees, and, in a moment, he
was on his feet crouching and gazing out into the impenetrable
snowfall. He moved aside from his fire and crept forward. Then he
stood up tall and straight, and his head was turned with an ear
to the outer world.</p>

<p class='c010'>A sound had reached ears trained to the pitch of any forest
creature. It had been faint, so faint, yet to Usak it was quite
unmistakable. It had come from out there on the water beyond the
ground ice, and he knew that some living thing was passing,
hidden by the grey of the snowfall.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood for a long time listening, his dark eyes no less
alert than his ears. Then with something like reluctance he came
back to the fire and spread his hands out over it. After awhile
he returned to his seat. There was no doubt in his mind. The
sound he had heard was the ruffling of the water stirred by the
dip of a paddle.</p>

<p class='c010'>But his shoulders moved in a shrug, and he dismissed the
matter. Why not? There were folk in the Valley of the Fire Hills,
other folk than those—Yes, far up, there were many of the folk he
hated but did not fear—the Euralians.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Usak was standing on the landing almost lost in the billows of
smoke surging down upon him. They belched out of the heart of the
wood which concealed the clearing, wherein had stood the secret
habitation of the man whom he had designed should know his final
vengeance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whole of the dripping valley seemed to be afire. Behind
him the roar and crackle of the burning forest grew louder, and
the suffocating smoke grew denser and denser while the heat was
blistering.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stepped quickly into his waiting kyak and pushed out into
the stream, vanishing in the twilight of the night. He paddled
rapidly till he had cleared the woodland belt and approached the
unlovely barrens of the Fire Hills. Then he sought the shelter of
the bank and shipped his paddle.</p>

<p class='c010'>He knelt up in the little vessel gazing back at the ruthless
work of his hands. It was there plain enough for him to see. The
billows of drifting smoke were darkly outlined against the
moonlit, star-decked heavens. And farther inland was the glowing
heart of the fire, with leaping splashes of flame lightening up
the world around it, hungrily devouring the splendid dwelling
that had once been the home of his most hated enemy.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was none of the joy in his mood that might have been
looked for. No. A light of fury was burning in his merciless
eyes. He had been thwarted in his long contemplated vengeance,
and he had been driven to the impotent devastation which his
savage heart had prompted. He had reached the place only to find
it utterly deserted. The house he found devoid of all life, and
his search had only yielded him further confirmation that his
intended victims had escaped him. So, in his insane savagery, he
had done the thing that alone would satisfy. He had fired the
house, and seen to it that even the woods about it should not
escape destruction.</p>

<p class='c010'>He remained for awhile contemplating the mischief of his
handiwork and drawing such comfort from it as his mood would
allow. Then, at last, feasted, satiated, he dipped his paddle
again into the sluggish waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>He knew. He understood. The chance had been his far back there
at the mouth of the creek. He had heard the sound of a paddle,
and should have guessed. But his wits had failed him, and the
snow had blinded him. But even now he did not wholly despair.
There was the winter. The man was blind. And the woman—Psha! He
drove his paddle with all the fury of his desire.</p>

    <div>THE IRONY OF FATE</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The race against the season was being won. The
race against that other—?</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, Bill Wilder was well enough satisfied. Not a day, not an
hour had been lost in his rush to the hills. He had spared no
effort. And on the return he had driven hard with the full weight
of the stream speeding him. There had been the one heavy
snowstorm as he had passed out of the mouth of the Valley of the
Fire Hills. For a few hours it had blinded him and forced him to
shelter. For the rest the luck of the weather had been with him,
with only the increasing cold and the twenty hour nights with
which to do battle.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was feeling good as he came to the familiar landing above
the Grand Falls, and prepared for his portage down to the canyon
of the rapids.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was all curious in its way, and there were moments on the
journey when he found himself half whimsically wondering at the
thing he was doing. For the man he was endeavouring to save from
the hands of Usak he had only utter loathing and detestation.
There was no pity in him, not a moment’s thought of it. For the
little distracted woman it was different. He knew he was risking
everything in life out of pity for this poor creature, who was
nothing in the world to him except that she was a woman, and not
even white at that. He realised his utter folly. He even reminded
himself that the thing he was doing was not only unfair to
himself, but to those others who looked to him for succour, that
other whose life had become focussed in him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He knew that an encounter with Usak would mean a battle to the
death of one or perhaps all of them. He knew that, embarrassed by
these helpless creatures, a sudden final onslaught of the Arctic
winter night might well mean the end of all things. But he had
not hesitated. No. He had calculated closely. His knowledge of
the northern world had told him that there was time—even time to
spare. The daylight had not yet passed, and, unless the season
was one of unusual severity, the dreaded freeze-up was not due
for several weeks more. No. The cold was steadily increasing.
There would be more snow yet. But there would be relapses of
temperature, and the final sealing of the great river was still a
long way off. So he had refused to be turned aside from his
purpose.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had laboured on with a mind steadily poised and with nerves
in perfect tune. His greatest apprehension was the possible
encountering of the Indian, Usak. And even on this his resolve
was clear and as merciless as anything the savage, himself, might
have contemplated. He was armed and ready, and no interference
would be tolerated even if his necessity drove him to
slaughter.</p>

<p class='c010'>The daylight had been spent in disgorging the two canoes of
their freight. He and the little Japanese woman had spent the
time preparing his packs. They were not vast, but the whole
portage would mean three laborious trips over the rough territory
of the great gorge down to the landing below.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first trip was to be his own canoe. The second was to be
the camp outfit of his passengers. The blind-man and the woman
would accompany him on that trip and help with the packs. Then,
with these folk safely encamped below the gorge, he would return
alone to bring down their canoe.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes. It was all clearly planned with a view to the simplest
and best advantage, and the preliminary work had gone on rapidly
under his energetic guidance. There was not one moment’s
unnecessary delay, for he understood, only too well, the value of
every precious hour he could steal on his human and elemental
adversaries.</p>

<p class='c010'>The last pack had been made up of the things that could be
dispensed with. His canoe was hauled up empty, ready to be
shouldered. And now, with the last flash of daylight shining in
the south-west, he stood low down on the foreshore gazing out
over the water in the direction of the misty falls. Mid-day was
only two hours gone and the daylight was already collapsing with
the falling sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>The peace of this far-off world was a little awesome, the
silence was something threatening. The dull roar of the Grand
Falls alone robbed it of utter, complete soundlessness. The snow
was a soft virgin carpet in every direction. The hardy, dark
woods were weighted down with its burden. For all there was shore
ice against the river bank the whole breadth of the waters of the
river were silently, heavily flowing on to the tremendous
precipitation far beyond. But it was not of these things that
Wilder was thinking. In the emergency besetting he was concerned
only for the signs which, out of his experience, he was striving
to interpret.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were very definite. The sun had fallen below the horizon,
accompanied by two pale sundogs that strove but failed to display
an angry glare. The horizon was clear of all cloud, a vault of
wonderful colour. Such breath of wind as was stirring was coming
up out of the south-east. It was good. It was all good. The
sundogs suggested possible, ultimate change, but not yet. The
breeze was almost mild. But above all there was not a single
cloud to shut out the light of the moon that would presently
rise, and the brilliant starlight, and the beneficent northern
lights. No. It would be a perfect night.</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned back to the couple hugging the tiny fire they had
ventured to light in the shelter of an attenuated bluff of
woods.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just get this clear,” he said thrusting his hands out to the
warmth. “I’m setting out right away. It’ll take me six hours to
make back here. Six hours good. I’d have been glad to cache your
boat back there in the woods, an’ hide up our tracks right. But
the snow on the ground beats us on that play. Any pair of eyes
happening along could follow us anywhere. No. If Usak’s around I
give him credit for being able to read our tracks anyway, and
with the snow, why they’re just shriekin’ at him. We got to take
a big chance. But ther’s one play we can make.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He paused and rubbed his hands thoughtfully while the eyeless
man gazed unerringly up into his face, and the woman beside him
waited a prey to apprehension.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You best beat it back into these woods,” he went on quickly.
“Leave that fire—burning. Leave it so it looks like dying out. As
if we were all out on portage. See? And you two make the woods,
dodging the snow patches, an’ walking on the bare ground. Take
your sleeping kit, and get what sleep you can—without a fire.
That’s all. I’ll get right back just as quick as I know. Once
we’re on the river below these Falls, why I guess Usak hasn’t a
chance. But I got to leave you one end or the other while I make
this first portage, an’ it seems horse sense leaving you above
the Falls. We haven’t seen a sign of that murdering Indian above
here the whole way.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The blindman nodded.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s sense,” he said in his harsh way.</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman silently acquiesced. It was sufficient that the man
had agreed. But her troubled eyes told of the haunting dread that
obsessed her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder turned away and moved over to his canoe lying ready. He
stooped down, and when he stood up again the little vessel was
exactly poised upon his broad back.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The hush of the woods was profound. The dark aisles of the
trees were visible in the moonlight, for the foliage above was
thin, and meagre, and tattered under the fierce storms which
roared down out of the heart of the hills. The promise of
sun-down had been fulfilled. A full moon shone down upon a chill,
silvery world, and the starlight was of that amazing brilliance
which is the great redeeming of the Arctic night. There was no
wind, not a breath. It was cold, intensely cold, and the northern
heavens were lit by an amazing wealth of vivid, moving
lights.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blindman and his woman made no pretence of the sleep that
Wilder had suggested. Sleep was impossible to them. They crouched
together in their sleeping furs, striving for any measure of
warmth for their chilled bodies. But they had otherwise obeyed.
For the thing suggested had appealed. They were deep hidden
amidst the tree trunks, waiting, waiting for that return which
alone could yield them any sense of security.</p>

<p class='c010'>They talked together spasmodically, and in low, hushed
tones.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the most part they talked in their own native tongue, but
sometimes they used the language of the country of their
adoption.</p>

<p class='c010'>The blindman’s hearing was doubly acute for his affliction.
And he crouched straining for any sound to warn them of lurking
danger. But the hours passed, and only the droning roar of the
distant Falls broke the soundlessness of the night.</p>

<p class='c010'>Crysa could contain her fears no longer. A sigh escaped her
and she stirred restlessly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will come?” she said, and her tone was full of besetting
doubt.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s reply was slow in coming. It almost seemed as though
the straining effort of listening completely pre-occupied
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He nodded at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He will come,” he rasped. Then he added, “He is a fool
whiteman.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The woman’s quick eyes lit as they glanced round on her
husband.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He is good,” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The scorn in the yellow man’s tone was something bitter beyond
words.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing more was said, and the man returned to his
listening.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>A long low kyak glided up to the landing. It came without
sound, for the stream was swift, and the shore ice had been
broken up by those who had come before. The trailing paddle was
lifted quickly from the water and the vessel’s occupant reached
out and caught the side of the boat lying moored against the
bank. Skilfully he guided the nose of his craft in between the
moored vessel and the bank, and the whole thing was completed in
absolute soundlessness.</p>

<p class='c010'>With his vessel lying stationary he remained for a moment
unmoving. His great body towered as he knelt up against his
paddling strut. He was surveying the moored boat with eager, dark
eyes and an acutely reading mind. Presently he turned from the
contemplation of the thing that had set a wild fierce hope
stirring in his savage heart. His gaze was flung upon the landing
itself, and upon the surrounding slope of the river bank, and the
adjacent bluff of woods. The brilliant night revealed all he
sought with a clearness which left him without a shadow of doubt.
Finally he discovered beyond, just within the shelter of the
woods, the last dying smoulder of the camp fire. He reached
towards the nose of his kyak, and seized the long rifle lying
there. Then he stepped ashore.</p>

<p class='c010'>The dark figure moved swiftly up the shore. It reached the
edge of the woods and stood for a moment gazing down on the dying
camp fire. The dark eyes had suddenly become fiercely urgent as
he searched every sign that was there for his interpretation.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a few moments the man moved about in the neighbourhood
of the fire. His moccasined feet gave out no sound. He was
searching diligently in the trodden snow. At last he came again
to a halt. He threw up his head and stared about him. It was the
attitude of a creature of the forest scenting its prey, and in
his eyes was a look of fierce exulting as he gazed into the dark
shelter of the woods. Then his whole attitude underwent a change.
He seemed to crouch down. His long rifle was borne at the trail
in his hand, and he moved forward stealthily, and became
swallowed up by the shadowed depths.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The hush of the night left the falling of a pine cone a sound
that was almost startling. The droning roar of the distant Falls
was only part of the awesome quiet. The windlessness was a threat
of greater and greater depths of cold, while the brilliant moon
and cloudless sky only helped to impress more deeply the intense
frigidity of the coming season. It was all perfect, in its
exquisite peace, a vision of superlative splendour in the amazing
twilight. It suggested a sublime creation unspoiled, unsullied by
any inharmonious blemish, a broad indefinite sketch set out by
the mighty brush and divine inspiration of a God-like artist who
only requires to inset the subtle, finishing details. Such was
the seeming of the moment.</p>

<p class='c010'>A cry. A series of raucous human cries. They came from
somewhere within the forest belt. They came full of terror, and
maybe pain. They came full of ferocious unyielding and savage
passion. They came again and again, with the shrill of a woman’s
voice mingling. Then the last sound died out, swallowed up by the
immense silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the grandeur of the night scene, the sublimity of Nature’s
profound calm, lost for a few brief moments by the invasion of an
expression of surging human passions, returned again, all
undefeated, to the rugged heart of the northern wilderness.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>The moon was still high in the starlit heavens, shedding its
cold benignity upon the flowing waters. The belt of the northern
lights had extended. Their ghostly sheen had deepened, and the
vivid arc of a burnished aurora had joined their legions. The
world was lit anew. The twilight had glorified; the night was
transformed. No longer was the moon the dominant light giver. The
jewel-like sparkle of the stars had dimmed in contrast. For the
aurora, the glory of the Arctic night, had ascended its
triumphant throne.</p>

<p class='c010'>The whiteman swung along, approaching the camping ground above
the Falls, filled with satisfaction and hope at the beneficent
change. For practical purposes the night light was
all-sufficient. In fancy he saw the completion of his labours in
far less time than he had anticipated, and something like
ultimate security for those he sought to succour.</p>

<p class='c010'>The further portage would be easy now. The first trip was
over. Now there was the bearing of the packs in which he would
have the assistance of those others. Then the last—the portage of
their—</p>

<p class='c010'>He had reached the low shore clearing of the landing. A great
flood of silvery light illuminated the whole breadth of the
river. There it lay a wide, swift tide, with the great hills far
across its bosom rising a jagged snowcapped line, gleaming like
burnished silver under the amazing heavenly lights.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the scene as Nature had painted it made not an instant’s
claim upon him. How should it? He had come to a sudden halt, his
gaze riveted upon a vision that made him draw his breath sharply,
and set his heart leaping. He became rooted to the spot. Two
boats were out there on the broad bosom of the river. Two of
them. And both were moving on down the stream towards—</p>

<p class='c010'>A shout broke from him. It came with all the power of his
well-nigh bursting lungs. It was the natural impulse which his
surge of feeling inspired. He shouted again and again. Then of a
sudden he charged down to the water’s edge, and stood staring
helplessly, silently, a prey to unspeakable horror.</p>

<p class='c010'>Two boats! The leading vessel was a long low kyak. There was
no mistaking its build. Just as there was no mistaking, to his
mind, the burly figure propelling it. The second boat he
recognised on the instant. It was the canoe he had expected to
portage on his third trip. In it were two figures sitting up.
They were motionless. They were paddleless. They were sitting,
inert, like bundles set there, and quite incapable of any
movement, incapable of any resistance. And between the two boats
stretched a taut line.</p>

<p class='c010'>It needed no second thought for Wilder to realise the thing
that was being enacted. The inhuman vengeance of the crazy Indian
had descended upon those benighted helpless folk and no power on
earth could save them.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak’s purpose was as clear as the brilliant light of the
night. The ruthless savage was towing them out into mid-stream.
Presently he would, doubtless, release their vessel when it had
reached the limit of safety for himself. Then he would leave them
to the hideous destruction awaiting them at the great waterfall
flinging back its thunderous roar out of the heart of the mists
enshrouding it.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no succour that he could offer. He was without any
means of reaching them with his own canoe already below the
Falls. And his automatic pistol was useless. No. He could only
stand there helplessly watching the terrible tragedy of it
all.</p>

<p class='c010'>Now he knew the thing that must have happened. He vividly
pictured the coming of Usak, whom they must have passed higher up
the river on their way down. The stillness of the figures in the
boat was terribly significant.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man must have come upon them in their hiding, perhaps
asleep. He must have overpowered them. Probably he had bound them
hand and foot when he set them in the boat, so that the blindman,
no less than the other, should contemplate, even if it was only
through his hearing, the dreadful death he was preparing for
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>He caught his breath. Then in a moment he hurled the full
force of his impotent loathing in a furious shout across the
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You swine! God Almighty!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The exclamation came as he saw the man cease paddling and
reach out to the rope behind him. In a moment it was severed, and
the trailing boat began instantly to turn broadside on to the
current.</p>

<p class='c010'>The watching man gave a gasp. Then the broadside boat was
forgotten, and his whole attention was given to the other, the
boat containing the demented creature perpetrating his
long-pondered crime.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak’s paddle was beating the water furiously. He was striving
with all his enormous strength and skill to swing his light
vessel out of the stream. He was labouring in a fashion that
instantly warned the on-looker of the peril besetting him. And
the sight of the struggle thrilled him with an excitement which
had no relation to any desire for the man’s escape.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak was a superb river man. Perhaps he had no equal upon the
northern waters. But he was an Indian with the lust to kill, and
without the sober judgment of the whiteman watching him from the
shore. Wilder understood. It was there for him to see. The Indian
had gone too far in his desire. He had passed the limits of
safety before he severed the rope to hurl his victims to the fate
he had designed for them. He was caught in the same overwhelming
rush of silent water. His paddle was no better than a toy thing
to stay the rush. His kyak was caught and flung broadside. And
abreast of the other it was drifting, drifting down upon the
roaring cataract ahead.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder drew a deep breath.</p>

<p class='c010'>Usak had ceased paddling. There was a moment in which he
remained utterly unmoving like those others. To the on-looker it
seemed that he was contemplating the full horror in which his
mistake had involved him. Then, of a sudden, he saw the dark
figure rear itself up in the boat, which, even at that distance,
seemed to rock perilously. The man stood erect. Then an arm was
raised and the paddle was flung into the racing waters. After
that it seemed that the doomed creature’s arms were folded across
his broad bosom, and, like a statue, unmoved by any emotion of
fear, he stood boldly contemplating the terrible doom towards
which he and his victims were inevitably being borne.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder turned away. It was all too painful. It was all too
horrible in its human wantonness. He passed up the shore and sat
down, pondering the irony of the fate that had descended upon the
demented man out there on the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>And after awhile, when the cold of the night drove him, and he
bestirred himself, and again moved down to the water’s edge, it
was to witness the placid unruffled bosom of the great river
flowing heavily on as it had done throughout the ages. The
trifling human tragedy it had witnessed was far too infinitely
small to leave its impress upon a scene so tremendous in its
expression of overwhelming Nature.</p>

    <div>THE END OF THE LONG TRAIL</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The transformation was complete. It was beyond
anything that had been dreamed of by those who had foreseen the
thing that would happen. It had come with that startling rapidity
which the lure and magic of gold never fails to bring about.</p>

<p class='c010'>Just before the break of spring saw the return to the Caribou
of Chilcoot and Bill Wilder. But their return was very different
from their adventurous going, when it had been a desperate race
against the season. They came while the grip of the Arctic night
was still fast upon the great waterways, and before the sun had
lifted its shining face above the horizon. They came with a great
equipment of men and material on heavily laden dog-sleds. They
came with all speed that not a moment of the coming daylight
might be lost, and to head off the rush of the human tide that
was already strung out behind them for the new adventure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill Wilder had not permitted the grievous tragedy he had
witnessed on the upper waters of the Hekor to deflect his purpose
one iota. The shock of the thing he had witnessed had been
painful beyond words. For the blind leader of the Euralian
marauders he had had not one grain of pity. For the great Indian,
who had given his life to the loyal service of the girl he loved,
there had been a regret that was not untinged with a sensation of
relief. He felt somehow that the thing was right; he felt that
had the demented creature achieved his purpose and himself
escaped, the position would have been fraught with serious
complications, not to say dangers. Usak would have expected to
return to his service of Felice as though nothing had happened.
He would have demanded the thing he looked upon as his right. And
to hold his place at her side he would have been prepared to use
any and all the methods his savage mind prompted.</p>

<p class='c010'>Wilder’s duty would have been obvious. The man had committed
his wanton crime. He was a serious danger to them all. Even, he
felt, to the girl herself. There would have been nothing for him
to do but hand the story of the crime to his friend, George
Raymes. That would have deeply involved him. The Kid would have
been hurt, hurt as he had no desire to hurt her, with the
knowledge of the hideous crime, and that the full penalty of
whiteman’s law had fallen upon the man who had been a second
father and devoted servant to her. As it was she need never know
the thing that had happened. No one need ever know the thing that
had happened, except Raymes, and perhaps Chilcoot, who would, he
knew, remain as silent as the grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had felt it was all for the best. And somehow, in those
moments in which he had witnessed the calm courage with which the
Indian had faced his terrible end a feeling of intense admiration
and sympathy went out to the savage whose conception of manhood
was so curious a blending of downright honesty and loyalty, of
hate to the limit of fiendish cruelty, and of an invincible
courage in face of personal disaster.</p>

<p class='c010'>But for the little Japanese woman his feelings were stirred to
the deepest. When he thought of her, body and soul he hated the
ruthless Indian with all the passionate manhood in him. And the
more deeply he pondered her tragic end, the more surely he cried
out against the seeming injustice that Fate could have allowed it
to come to pass.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had sat for hours over the flickering camp fire before he
contemplated continuing his labours. But in the end the shock of
the horror passed, and the urgency of the moment bestirred him.
There was nothing to be done but to continue his journey. There
was no need even to obliterate such traces of the camp as might
remain. It was the way of Nature in these far-flung regions to
hide up man’s track almost in the moment of his passing.</p>

<p class='c010'>So he had made his way down to Placer, not even pausing at the
rapids at the mouth of the Caribou, so vivid with happy memories
for him. It was a journey of weeks that taxed every ounce of the
manhood in him. For the night of winter had fallen, and the
storming world about him was often doubly blinded. But he reached
his destination at last, and reached it with the last of the open
water.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was his return to Placer that set the whole city agog. It
was known he had been about in the north for two open seasons.
And the conclusions drawn were natural enough in a gold community
watching the movements of the man who was the leading figure in
the traffic upon which it was engaged.</p>

<p class='c010'>He denied every inquiry by which he was assailed. He denied
even his friend, and, for the time being, chief, George Raymes.
He visited him at once. And with his first greeting explained in
a fashion he had long since prepared.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m right glad to see you again, George,” he declared, as
they gripped hands. “Ther’ve been times when I didn’t guess it
would happen ever. But I’ve so far beat the game, and I’m glad.
Now, see, right here,” he went on, smiling whimsically into the
other’s questioning eyes, “I haven’t any report to hand you yet.
And I’ll take it more than friendly you don’t ask me a thing. I’m
setting right out with one big outfit, and if the game goes my
way I’ll be right back when the earth’s dry, and the skitters are
humming. And when that time comes I’ll hand you a story that
ought to set you sky high with the folks who run your end of the
game. Do you feel like acting that way?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The policeman was content. He knew Wilder too well to press
him. Besides, Chilcoot had been in the city weeks. Chilcoot had
been in close contact with the Gold Commissioner. Furthermore,
Chilcoot had been preparing the return outfit, collecting men and
material for a swift rush, and had talked with him in his office.
So he readily acquiesced, and left these “special” constables to
work out their plans in the way they saw fit.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the whisper had gone round. Bill Wilder and Chilcoot Massy
were preparing a great outfit for the trail. Bill Wilder and
Chilcoot Massy were buying largely. And their purchases were of
all that material required in the exploitation of a big “strike.”
Then word had leaked out through the Gold Commissioner’s office,
as, somehow, it always contrived to do when something of real
magnitude was afoot. So the “sharps,” and the “wise-guys,” and
the traders, and all the riff-raff, ready to jump in on anything
offering a promise of easy gain, bestirred themselves out of
their winter’s pursuit of pleasure. Not one, but a hundred
outfits were quietly being prepared with the deliberate intention
of dogging these great captains of the gold trade to their
destination. Chilcoot and Wilder were preparing for the winter
trail. And as a result every dog and sled within the city was
brought into commission.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then had come the setting out. It was arranged with the utmost
secrecy. The preparations of these men had been made beyond the
straggling town’s limits, so that the get-away could be as sudden
as they chose to make it. Every man engaged to accompany them was
under bond to report each day at the camp at a given hour, and
this had gone on since the moment of their engagement. It was on
this rule Wilder depended for his get-away from those who were
determined to follow.</p>

<p class='c010'>For days and weeks the outfit stood ready. Each day the dogs
were harnessed, and every man was in his place. Then the word was
passed to unhitch, and the men were permitted to return to the
city.</p>

<p class='c010'>The intending pursuit knew the game from A to Z. It was not
new. It had been practised a hundred times. It was no less ready.
It was no less on the watch. When the start was actually made
word would reach them within two hours and the whole wolf pack
would jump.</p>

<p class='c010'>So it happened. One day the men did not return to the city.
But word came back, and the rush began. Out into the twilight of
the Arctic night leapt the army of trail dogs and their
teamsters. Hundreds of sleds hissed their way over the snow-bed
on the great river. Hundreds of voices shouted the jargon of the
trail at their eager beasts of burden, and the fierce whips flung
out. Many were rushing on disaster in the blind northern night.
Many would never reach the hoped-for goal to grab the alluring
wealth from the bosom of mother earth. But that was always the
way of it. Whatever the threat, whatever the dread, whatever the
possibility of disaster, the lust of gold in the hearts of these
people remained triumphant.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the thing worked out for Wilder as he designed. The old
tried artifice gave him the start he needed. Three hours was all
he required. For the rest these hardy adventurers behind him
would never see the snow dust from his sled runners. He was
equipped for a speed such as none of them could compete with, and
if the weather became bad he calculated to lose the pursuit
utterly.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a storming journey. The North he loved and courted did
her best for him in return. Snow-storm and blizzard came to his
aid, and, after weeks of terrible hardship, he reached the
Caribou with his track lost beneath feet of drift snow.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had gained all the time he needed. And so when the spring
sun rose above the horizon, and the world of ice began its
thunderous peals of disintegration, and the hordes of Placer
swarmed on the banks of the Caribou he had established his outfit
upon the staked claims ready to hurl at the work before him, and
defend his property from all lawless aggression.</p>

<p class='c010'>With the return of daylight it was a bewildering scene on the
river. From its mouth right up to the gold-working on the creek,
which had lain so long hidden, the tide of adventurers was
swarming. And almost with every passing hour the flood seemed to
grow. The low banks were dotted with tents and habitations of
almost every sort of primitive construction. And men and women,
and even children, were like human flies where for ages the
silence of the North had remained all unbroken.</p>

<p class='c010'>As the season advanced and the fever of work developed to its
height, the reality of the thing became evident. Gold? Why the
original strike was little more than the fringe of the thing
awaiting those whose hardihood had been sufficient for them to
survive the winter journey. The creek, as Chilcoot had suggested,
was laden with its immense treasure, and rich claims were staked
for ten miles up its narrow course. “The Luck of the Kid,” as
Wilder had christened it, was a veritable Eldorado.</p>

<p class='c010'>The homestead lying back in its shelter of windswept bluff had
no place in the bustle and traffic on the river. It was a home of
even deeper calm now than was its wont when the northern world
aroused itself at the dawn of the open season. Usually at such a
time the caribou herd was brought in, and the work its advent
entailed never failed to absorb the rising spirits of those young
lives, ready like the simple wild flowers of spring, to hurl
themselves into their annual labours after the long night of
winter’s inactivity. Usually at such a time it was the hub of
life upon the river, literally teeming in contrast with the
stillness of the cheerless valley. But now the herd remained at
large free to drift back to its original wild state. The corrals
were empty and unrepaired, for there was no Usak to guide the
efforts of the half-breed Eskimo, and no half-breed Eskimo to
need such guidance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The farm had died in the winter night. And curiously enough
there were no mourners. All that remained was the homestead
itself, with Hesther McLeod and the girl children, and the Kid,
to enjoy its sturdy shelter. The half-breeds had joined in the
rush for gold. And Clarence, and Alg, and Perse were out there,
away up the river “batching it” on their claims, absorbed in the
exhilarating pursuit of extracting the wealth which had been
literally flung into their hands. Then Usak had failed to return
from his “one big trip.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Hesther and the Kid were at the kitchen door, and with them
was the author of the amazing transformation.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was a day of brilliant sunshine with a spring sky of white,
frothing, windswept cloud that broke, and gathered, and swept on,
yielding a vision of brilliant blue sky at every break. Already
the flies were making their presence felt, and the river was a
rushing torrent, wide, and deep, and brown with the sweepings of
its completely submerged banks.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were gazing out upon the distant panorama of the busy
river. They were watching the general movement going on. There
were men moving up, packing their goods afoot since the river was
for the moment un-navigable for the light craft, which, as yet,
were alone available. There were traders building shanties for
the housing of their wares. There were tents which sheltered
those who were relying on the gambler’s desire for their share in
the feast. There were other habitations which housed, the even
more disreputable creatures, who, like vultures, hover always in
the distance waiting to glut themselves upon the spoils of the
wayside. Then, much more in their appeal to the gentle mind of
Hesther, there were the figures of women, staunch, devoted women
carrying on their simple domestic labours while their men were
absent farther up the river seeking the treasure which their
dazzled eyes yearned to gaze upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>For all they were gazing upon the scene Hesther and the Kid
were far more deeply interested in Bill Wilder and the thing he
was saying. The eyes of the girl were shining with unfeigned
happiness and delight. The long winter of his absence had been
ended weeks ago, and his early return had transformed her whole
outlook. From the moment of his coming there had been no more
darkness for her, no more anxious waiting. For had not almost his
first words been to tell her that his work, that work which had
taken him from her side, was finished; completely, successfully
finished. The excitement of the gold rush, the excitement of the
boys had left her undisturbed. But the happy excitement of this
man’s return had thrilled her in a fashion that left her without
thought or care for anything else. And now he was detailing those
plans which envisaged for her simple mind all that was beautiful
and desirable in life.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You see,” he said, “ther’s not a thing here now to keep us.
It’s just the other way around. All this.” He indicated the life
on the river. “We best get out before—before it gets worse, as it
surely will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned directly to Hesther.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My organization’s right up there on the claims, under the
control of Chilcoot, and they’re working your stuff same as if it
was for me. And the result of it’ll come along through my office,
just the same as if it was mine. I’m not needed around up there.
Maybe I best tell you I’m so full of gold I don’t care ever to
see fresh colour. I want to quit it all, and take you folks along
with me. The boys can stop around and Chilcoot’ll see to ’em. And
we’ll just get along down and fix things the way we want ’em.
Ther’s a swell house waiting in Placer for you, mam. It’s all
fixed good. It’s your home, for you an’ yours just as soon as you
feel like taking possession, and maybe the Kid here’ll feel like
stopping along with you till—till—Say,” he turned to the smiling
girl, “we won’t let a thing keep us waiting, eh? We’ll get
married right away in Placer, just as quick as things can be
fixed right. Then your Mum, here, can choose just where she feels
like living. That so?”</p>

<p class='c010'>There was no need for verbal response. It was there in the
girl’s eyes, which smiled happily up into his as she slipped her
brown hand through his arm.</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s the way I’d like to fix things,” he went on, taking
possession of the girl’s hand. “Does it suit you, mam?” he said,
turning again to Hesther. “Just say right here. Ther’s a bank
roll waiting on you down there, in the way of an advance on the
stuff that’s coming to you out of your claim. And I’ll be around
all the time to see you ain’t worried a thing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The gentle-eyed mother opened her lips to speak. But words
seemed difficult under his steady gaze. Wilder glanced quickly
away, and the woman’s emotion passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I just don’t know how to say the thing I feel, Bill,” she
said softly. “The thing you’ve been to me an’ mine. God’ll surely
bless you, an’—an’—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill laughed. He felt his laugh was needed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not a word that way. Say, you been mother to my little Kid.
It goes?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure. The thing you say goes with me—all the time.” Hesther
glanced hastily back into the kitchen. She was seeking excuse and
found it in her simple labours.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess that stew’ll be boilin’,” she said. “I’ll go fix
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>And Billy’s happy smile followed her into the room, while he
caressed the hand he was holding.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Bill and the Kid had passed on down to the landing so pregnant
with memories for them both.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the girl who was talking now while the man stared out
down the busy river.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know, Bill. I just don’t sort of understand the way
this—this gold makes folks act. It sort of seems to set them
kind of crazy. The boys are the same. I used to feel it would be
fine to have dollars an’ dollars. I used to think of all the
swell food and clothes I’d buy for the boys, an’ Hesther, an’ the
girls. That was all right. But I didn’t get crazy for gold like
these folk. You say ther’s a heap of gold in my claim. I—I don’t
seem to feel I want a thing of it. True I don’t.” She laughed.
“Maybe you’ll guess I’m more crazy than they are. Do you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Kid. I don’t,” he said gently. “I’m glad. Later, maybe,
when we’re married, and you’ve got around, and learned about
things, and seen the things you can have with gold you’ll feel
different. But I’m glad it don’t get you that way now. I tell you
ther’s a big heap more to life than this gold. But ther’s a heap
of good things you can do with gold. You feel you want to make
other folks happy and comfortable? Well, gold’ll help you that
way. I bin all my life collecting a bunch of this dam old stuff,
and I’d learned to hate it good. Well, it’s not that way now.
Say, I just lie awake at nights thinkin’ the things I can do for
you, and the folks belonging to you. And I got to like the darn
stuff again. And I’m just as crazy glad as all those other poor
folk I got it.” He smiled whimsically down into the girl’s eyes.
“The outfit’s ready, Kid. I’ve had it ready days,” he went on.
“Ther’s two big canoes, and they’ll hold your Mum, and the gals,
and you and me and the half-breeds to paddle. When do you say,
little girl? It’s right up to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He waited anxiously for the girl’s reply. Watching her he saw
the happy smile fade abruptly out of her eyes, and he knew the
bad moment he had foreseen had arrived.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Usak hasn’t got back,” she said quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly the girl withdrew her hand from the rough cloth arm
of the man’s pea-jacket.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You know I just can’t understand the thing that’s happened.
He’s been gone six months. He went, as I told you, right after
you, and we haven’t heard a thing. You know, Bill, it kind of
seems to me he’s—dead. I sort of feel it right here,” she went
on, pressing her hands to her bosom. “An’—an’ I feel—Oh, he was
an Indian I know, but he was the feller who raised me like a
father an’ mother. An’ I sort of loved him for it, an’—an’—I just
can’t bear to quit till—till— Don’t you understand? I sort of
feel I must wait for him. It would break him all up if I quit
him. And I—I don’t want to quit him. Indeed I don’t.”</p>

<p class='c010'>For some moments Bill made no attempt to reply. He remained
staring out at the surging river as it roared on down under the
freshet. He did not even attempt to comfort the girl in her
obvious distress.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was difficult. But Bill was steadily resolved not to tell
the real truth as he knew it. It would break her heart to know
Usak to be the fierce fiend he was. No. If necessary he would lie
in preference.</p>

<p class='c010'>He shook his head at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“He won’t come back,” he said decidedly. “Get a grip on the
position. He went on a winter trip. He set out in his kyak, you
told me. He went with a light outfit and his rifle. Why, his kyak
couldn’t carry two months’ grub, an’ he’s been away six. Let’s
guess a bit. We know this old North. The winter trail. We know
these rivers with the ice crowding down on ’em. We know you’ve
only to beat the winter trail long enough to get your med’cine.
The North gets us all beaten in the end if we don’t quit in time.
The one way trail’s claimed Usak, little girl, if I’m a judge.
No. Don’t wait on his return. If he gets back Chilcoot’ll send
him right along on to us. If he’s alive I mean to have him with
us. I squared things with him before he went so he’ll be glad to
be with us both. Let’s leave it that way. Eh?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The girl’s hand had stolen back to its place on the man’s arm,
and he took possession of it again. To her he was irresistible,
and then there was that wonderful, wonderful time coming.</p>

<p class='c010'>She nodded her fair head, and the smile dawned once more in
her eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I guess it’s best—but—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s right.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man drew a deep breath of relief. He had been saved a
deliberate lie. And his eyes smiled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To-morrow?” he said quickly.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the girl was no less quick in her denial.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mum couldn’t be ready. Ther’s the boys.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill laughed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I forgot. This day week, eh?” he went on urgently. “The
river’ll slacken then. That do?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The Kid laughed happily as he squeezed the soft hand lying so
contentedly in his.</p>

<hr class='c012' />

<p class='c010'>Superintendent Raymes laid aside the folded sheets of the
closely written report which he had read several times over. For
a moment he sat gazing at it thoughtfully. Then he reached across
his desk and selected a long cigar, and passed the box to his
visitor and temporary subordinate.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Best take one, Bill,” he said. Then he laughed quietly. “You
can only die once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I don’t want to die—now.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill shook his head and pulled a pipe from the pocket of his
pea-jacket.</p>

<p class='c010'>In a moment both men were smoking. Bill gazed about him while
he waited for the other to speak. It was the same office he had
always known. Simple, plain, typical of the lives of these
Mounted Policemen. Somehow it appealed to him just now infinitely
more than it had ever done before. He remembered his mood that
time when he had sat in the same chair two years before. And
somehow he wanted to laugh.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It’s an amazing story, Bill,” Raymes said after awhile. “I
guessed when I got you interested two years back there was a deal
to it. But I never reckoned it was going to be the thing it is.
Say—” His eyes lit and he swung his chair about and faced the
other while he held his cigar poised streaming its smoke upon the
somewhat dense atmosphere of the room. “By all accounts the folk
hereabouts owe you a deal for the nosing of Le Gros’ ‘strike.’
It’s the biggest since ‘Eighty-Mile’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill shook his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nobody owes me a thing—not even thanks. We’ve helped
ourselves. And I’ve helped myself most of all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I thought you said you hadn’t a claim on it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“That’s so.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill laughed outright.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Guess you’ve forgotten the ‘girl-child, white.’” Raymes
nodded. His usually sober face was smiling in response.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know. You located her.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sure I did.” Bill sucked happily at his old pipe. “I located
her. And I brought her and her folks right down with me to this
city. I fixed ’em all up in a swell house, and made things right
for them. The Kid and I are going to be married in two weeks from
now. And I’ll take it friendly for you to stand by me when the
passon fixes things. No, I don’t guess anyone owes me a thing.
The Kid herself is my claim, an’ she’s chock full of the only
gold that sets me yearning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, say!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The police officer sat gazing in smiling astonishment.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seems queer?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. I’m just glad I’ve had a hand in passing you that claim.
Good luck, Bill. I’m sure your man.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill gripped the hand thrust out at him. Then the smile passed
out of both men’s faces as if by agreement. After all the
policeman’s work was his foremost concern.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It don’t seem to me there’s a thing to do about your story of
this murdering Indian, and the folks he dragged to death with
him,” he said, in his alert official way. “In a way it’s a sort
of poetic justice on all concerned. I’ll need to pass it along
with the official report, but it’ll maybe just end right there.
But these Euralians. That’s a swell scoop for me, sure. It’s a
thing for Ottawa, an’ll need to go down in detail. Maybe you’ll
be needed to hand further information. Japanese, eh? Well, it
isn’t new in this western country. It’s the same from northern
Alaska down to Panama. The darn continent’s alive with ’em,
penetrating peacefully, and robbing us white folks of our
birthright. You know, Bill ther’s a bad day coming for us whites.
We sit around an’ look on, shrugging our shoulders, and eating
and sleeping well. And all the time this thing’s creeping on us,
like some dam disease. The Americans know it, and are alive to
the danger. We don’t seem to worry. At least, not officially. But
I sort of see the day coming when this thing’s got to be fought
sheer out, and I’m by no means sure of the outcome. We’re told
the Yellow man in the West outnumbers the White. But that don’t
suggest a thing of the reality. When the Yellow men mean to
strike you’ll find they’ve honeycombed this country, and the
States, and it’ll be something like four to one waiting to rise
at the given word. Yes, it’s bad,” he finished up, with a grave
shake of the head. “But you certainly have given me a swell scoop
that should help my boat along with Ottawa. Guess you won’t feel
like quitting our territory now, eh?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s manner had changed from gravity to something
bantering as he put his question.</p>

<p class='c010'>“More than ever,” Bill said, with a shake of the head.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But it’s the North’s given you all—this?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes. That’s so, George.” Bill knocked out his pipe. “But you
don’t know. Felice has been raised in the darkness of that darn
region, almost without decent human comfort. She hasn’t known a
thing but buckskin and the river trail, and the flies and
skitters of a barren world for twenty of the best years of her
life. She doesn’t know a thing but an almighty fight to make
three meals of food a day, and a night passed in queer brown
blankets an’ caribou pelts. Well, it’s up to me to teach her the
thing life is and can be. I’m going to. I’m going to give her
such a time she won’t remember those days. She’s going where the
sun’s warm and life’s dead easy. And so are those belonging to
her. It’s up to me, and I’m out to do it. You haven’t seen her
yet. You’d understand if you had. She’s right outside sitting
waiting for me in the buggy. Will you come along and say a word
of welcome to her?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Bill had risen to his feet. There was just a shade of
eagerness in his invitation. It was almost as if he feared
reluctance in this old friend of his.</p>

<p class='c010'>But there was none. Not a shadow. Raymes rose from his desk on
the instant, and his eyes were full of swift censure.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You kept her waiting there, Bill?” he cried. “You? Say, come
right on and present me, so I can tell her the thing I think of
you.”</p>

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
